# Package each Claude Code skill as an individual ZIP for manual import into
# the Claude Desktop app via Settings > Customize > Skills.
#
# Usage:
#   ./package-skills.sh [skills-dir] [output-dir]
#
# Defaults to .claude/skills/ for skills and build/skills/ for output.
# Reads skills.location from [tool.repomatic] in pyproject.toml if present.
#
# --- Why this exists ---
#
# Claude has three separate skill systems that do not share a registry:
#
#   1. Claude Code (CLI + Desktop Code tab)
#      Skills live in ~/.claude/skills/ (personal) or .claude/skills/ (project).
#      Auto-discovered at runtime, invocable via /skill-name. The Desktop
#      Customize > Skills panel does not display them (UI bug, not a loading
#      bug: they still work via the / menu).
#
#   2. Claude Desktop chat (claude.ai / Desktop app chat mode)
#      Runs in a server-side container. Skills are mounted at /mnt/skills/.
#      User skills go to /mnt/skills/user/ but the mount is unreliable:
#      metadata is registered in the system prompt, yet SKILL.md files are
#      often not mounted on disk (see #26254). The only upload path is the
#      Customize > Skills panel: one ZIP per skill, no batch import, no API.
#
#   3. Cowork
#      Another container. Reads project-level .claude/skills/ from the
#      session mount, but ignores ~/.claude/skills/ (personal skills).
#      Opening a project that contains .claude/skills/ exposes those skills
#      to Cowork. Skills may appear in Customize but fail to load in chat
#      due to context budget limits (see #40774).
#
# This script packages each skill as a ZIP for manual upload to surface 2.
# It cannot automate the upload: the Desktop app sends ZIPs to Anthropic's
# servers via its Electron bridge, and there is no public API or local
# storage to write to.
#
# As of April 2026, even the manual upload is unreliable: uploaded skills
# have their metadata registered in the system prompt, but SKILL.md files
# are often not mounted on the container filesystem (#26254), and uploads
# sometimes return internal server errors (#26310). Keep this script for
# when the server-side mount is fixed.
#
# --- Workaround for Cowork ---
#
# Cowork mounts project-level .claude/skills/ into the session container.
# Opening the project in Cowork exposes the skills: they are readable on
# disk but not registered as / slash commands. Tell Cowork to read and
# follow a skill directly, e.g.:
#
#   "Read and follow .claude/skills/repomatic-audit/SKILL.md"
