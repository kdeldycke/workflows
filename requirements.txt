# We use Pip over Poetry as this repository is not intended to be a standalone Python package. I.e. we do not have
# any intention to distribute it on PyPi.
# Also, a project relying on this repository can point to this external requirement.txt,
# even from its Poetry's venv. We cannot do that with Poetry, as it doesn't support sub-venvs.
# All versions are pinned so we have ultimate control over reproducibility.
