# Changelog

## [`6.3.0.dev0` (unreleased)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.1.0...main)

> [!WARNING]
> This version is **not released yet** and is under active development.

- Consolidate documentation.
- Trim verbose workflow YAML comments that are now documented in Python code, replacing them with brief pointers to the relevant module.
- Add knowledge placement guide to `CLAUDE.md` with audience-based routing table and YAML→Python distillation pattern.
- Add misplaced knowledge detection to QA agent checklists.
- Add `rename-from` rules to migrate all 9 default GitHub labels.
- Add `init-exclude` config option to skip components during `repomatic init`. Extend `workflow-sync-exclude` to also apply to `repomatic init` workflows. Default `init-exclude` to `["labels", "linters", "skills"]` since these files are regenerated by workflows at execution time.
- Pre-compute availability admonition in `release_notes_with_admonition` metadata output so GitHub releases include PyPI and GitHub links at creation time, without waiting for the `fix-changelog` + `sync-github-releases` round-trip.
- Support GitHub immutable releases by restructuring the release workflow to draft-then-publish.
- Add `repomatic-topics` skill for optimizing GitHub repository topics for discoverability.
- Add `lint-repo` check that warns when GitHub topics are not a subset of `pyproject.toml` keywords.
- Replace `calibreapp/image-actions` with `repomatic optimize-images` CLI command using lossless `oxipng` (PNG) and `jpegoptim` (JPEG). Exclude WebP and AVIF for lack of stability.
- Use GFM admonitions (`> [!WARNING]`) instead of emoji-prefixed blockquotes in the setup guide template.
- Add `sync-dev-release` CLI command and workflow job to maintain a rolling dev pre-release on GitHub with latest binaries and Python package.

## [`6.1.0` (2026-02-26)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.0.1...v6.1.0)

- Add `unsubscribe-threads` CLI command to unsubscribe from closed, inactive GitHub notification threads.
- Generate thin caller workflows with explicit secret forwarding instead of `secrets: inherit`, eliminating zizmor's `secrets-inherit` warnings in downstream repositories.
- Move zizmor config from `.github/zizmor.yml` to `zizmor.yaml` at repo root for visibility and consistency with other root-level config files.
- Centralize PAT existence check via workflow-level `env` block, replacing duplicated `secrets.*` ternary expressions in PAT hint steps and the `setup-guide` invocation.
- Restrict binary compilation to the HEAD commit for non-release pushes, avoiding redundant Nuitka builds across all commits in multi-commit push events.
- Add `prebake-version` CLI command to inject Git commit hash into `__version__` before Nuitka compilation. Standalone binaries now report the exact commit they were built from (e.g., `6.1.0.dev0+abc1234`).
- Pre-bake dev versions automatically in the `compile-binaries` workflow job before Nuitka runs.
- Detect orphaned versions in `lint-changelog`: versions that exist as git tags, GitHub releases, or PyPI packages but have no changelog entry. In `--fix` mode, insert placeholder sections with correct comparison URLs.
- Rename `lint-changelog` workflow job to `fix-changelog` since it always runs with `--fix`. The CLI command remains `lint-changelog`.
- Group CLI commands into sections (Project setup, Release & versioning, Sync, Linting & checks, GitHub issues & PRs) for better discoverability in help output.
- Add `list-skills` CLI command to display all available Claude Code skills grouped by lifecycle phase (Setup, Development, Quality, Release).
- Add next-step handoff suggestions to all Claude Code skills, creating a guided workflow where each skill suggests what to run next.
- Document skills with a grouped table, recommended workflow sequence, and walkthrough example in `readme.md`.
- Add `pypi-package-history` config option for renamed projects. `lint-changelog` now fetches releases from former package names and generates correct PyPI URLs for each version.
- Add `sync-github-releases` CLI command to sync GitHub release notes from `changelog.md`.
- Make changelog entry and GitHub release body assembly template-driven. `release-notes.md` controls `changelog.md` layout (including the `##` version heading), `github-releases.md` controls GitHub release bodies. Editing one template affects only its destination.
- Converge `freeze()` and `update()` onto the same decompose→render→replace pattern used by `lint_changelog_dates()`, with the `release-notes.md` template as the single source of truth for section layout.
- Only produce XML coverage and JUnit XML output when running `pytest` in the CI workflow.

## [`6.0.1` (2026-02-24)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.0.0...v6.0.1)

> [!NOTE]
> First release under the [`repomatic`](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/) name on PyPI, after `repokit` was rejected for typo-squatting (see `6.0.0` below). The GitHub repository is [`kdeldycke/repomatic`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic).

- Rename project from `repokit` to `repomatic`. Rename GitHub repository from `kdeldycke/repokit` to `kdeldycke/repomatic`.

## [`6.0.0` (2026-02-24)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v5.14.0...v6.0.0)

> [!CAUTION]
> This release was deleted from PyPI. It was supposed to be published as `repokit`, but PyPI flagged the name as typo-squatting the pre-existing [`repo-kit`](https://pypi.org/project/repo-kit/) package.

- Rename project from `gha-utils` to `repokit`. Rename GitHub repository from `kdeldycke/workflows` to `kdeldycke/repokit`.

## [`5.14.0` (2026-02-24)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v5.13.0...v5.14.0)

> [!NOTE]
> Final release under the [`gha-utils`](https://pypi.org/project/gha-utils/) name on PyPI. The project was renamed to [`repomatic`](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/) in `6.0.1`. The GitHub repository moved from `kdeldycke/workflows` to `kdeldycke/repomatic`.

- Add messages to redirect PyPI package from `gha-utils` to `repokit` and GitHub repository from `kdeldycke/workflows` to `kdeldycke/repokit`.

## [`5.13.0` (2026-02-23)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v5.12.0...v5.13.0)

- Harmonize sync/update naming across CLI commands, workflow jobs, PR branches, and templates. `sync-X` means regenerate from a canonical source; `update-X` means compute from project state. Breaking renames: `update-gitignore` → `sync-gitignore`, `mailmap-sync` → `sync-mailmap`, `deps-graph` → `update-deps-graph`. New `sync-bumpversion` CLI command replaces `init bumpversion` in the autofix job. Fix `autofix-typo` branch → `fix-typos`.
- Add Claude Code skills (`.claude/skills/`) wrapping `gha-utils` CLI commands as slash commands: `/gha-init`, `/gha-changelog`, `/gha-release`, `/gha-lint`, `/gha-sync`, `/gha-deps`, `/gha-test`, `/gha-metadata`. Distribute skills via `gha-utils init skills` and `gha-utils sync-skills` for downstream repos.
- Add `sync-renovate` CLI command and autofix workflow job to keep downstream `renovate.json5` in sync with the canonical reference from `gha-utils`. Opt out via `renovate-sync = false` in `[tool.gha-utils]`.
- Add `workflow-sync` and `workflow-sync-exclude` config keys to `[tool.gha-utils]` for per-project control over which workflows are synced. Explicit CLI positional arguments override both settings.
- Add `--format header-only` mode to `gha-utils workflow sync` for syncing headers (`name`, `on`, `concurrency`) of non-reusable workflows like `tests.yaml`.
- Use explicit `--format thin-caller` in `autofix.yaml` sync step.
- Fix race condition where binary builds could finish before `create-release`, causing `gh release upload` to fail with "release not found". Make `compile-binaries` depend on `create-release`.
- Add `lint-workflow-security` job to lint workflow using [`zizmor`](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor) to detect security vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions workflows. Closes #1478.
- Add `sync-linter-configs` CLI command and autofix job to sync `.github/zizmor.yml` to downstream repos. Add `linters` init component.
- Add per-project dependency graph configuration to `[tool.gha-utils]`: `dependency-graph-all-groups`, `dependency-graph-all-extras`, `dependency-graph-no-groups`, `dependency-graph-no-extras`, and `dependency-graph-level`. The `update-deps-graph` command reads these as defaults, with CLI flags taking precedence. The autofix workflow no longer hardcodes `--all-groups --all-extras`.

## [`5.12.0` (2026-02-22)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v5.11.1...v5.12.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `5.12.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gha-utils/5.12.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v5.12.0).

- Decouple GitHub release creation from binary builds. The release is published immediately after tagging with the Python package only; each binary uploads itself independently as its build completes.
- Remove `gha-utils collect-artifacts` subcommand. Binary renaming and upload is now handled directly in the `compile-binaries` workflow job.
- Add `nuitka-extra-args` config field to `[tool.gha-utils]` for project-specific Nuitka flags. Remove hard-coded Nuitka includes from the workflow. Fixes downstream repos failing on `gha_utils/templates/*.md` include.
- Add `🪫 AI slop` label. Merge `🎁 feature request` into `✨ enhancement`. Fix label descriptions and normalize hex color casing.

## [`5.11.1` (2026-02-21)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v5.11.0...v5.11.1)

> [!NOTE]
> `5.11.1` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gha-utils/5.11.1/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v5.11.1).

- Declare `WORKFLOW_UPDATE_GITHUB_PAT` as an optional `workflow_call` secret to fix downstream compatibility.

- Fix `gha-utils workflow sync` defaulting to `@main` instead of the version tag when run from a released package.

## [`5.11.0` (2026-02-21)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v5.10.4...v5.11.0)

> [!NOTE]

- Add `--no-group`, `--no-extra`, `--only-group`, and `--only-extra` options to `deps-graph` command.
- Make `gha-utils init bumpversion` idempotent: updates existing `[tool.bumpversion]` configs with dev versioning keys (`parse`, `serialize`, `[parts.dev]`) and bumps `current_version` to `.dev0`.
- Add `::error::` annotation when `create-pull-request` fails due to missing `WORKFLOW_UPDATE_GITHUB_PAT` secret.
- Add `Dependabot alerts` and `Issues` permissions to setup-guide issue template, matching the readme.
- Document which jobs use `WORKFLOW_UPDATE_GITHUB_PAT` and why each permission is needed.
- Skip PyPI package build for the post-release bump commit during releases.

## [`5.10.4` (2026-02-19)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v5.10.3...v5.10.4)

> [!NOTE]

- Replace `revert-squash-merge` auto-revert with `detect-squash-merge` notification. On accidental squash merge of a release PR, the job now opens a GitHub issue and fails the workflow instead of reverting on `main`. The release is skipped; the maintainer releases the next version when ready.
- Skip `lint-changelog` job on release and post-release commits.
- Skip Nuitka binary builds for the post-release bump commit during releases, halving the number of builds.
- Fix freeze/unfreeze cycle corrupting YAML and JSON5 comments that mention `--from . gha-utils`.

- Add `--include-package-data=extra_platforms` to Nuitka build to fix `FileNotFoundError` on `architecture_data.py` in compiled binaries.
- Add `sync-uv-lock` command that runs `uv lock` and avoid `exclude-newer-package` timestamp noise.
- Add `sync-uv-lock` job to `autofix.yaml` to replace Renovate's `lockFileMaintenance`, which cannot reliably revert timestamp-only noise in `uv.lock`.
- Remove `update-exclude-newer` command.
- Remove Renovate `lockFileMaintenance` configuration and its `postUpgradeTasks` rule.
- Revert `exclude-newer` in `pyproject.toml` from a fixed date to `"1 week"`.

## [`5.10.2` (2026-02-18)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v5.10.1...v5.10.2)

> [!NOTE]
> `5.10.2` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gha-utils/5.10.2/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v5.10.2).
