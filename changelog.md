# Changelog

## [`7.15.1.dev0` (unreleased)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.15.0...main)

> [!WARNING]
> This version is **not released yet** and is under active development.

- **Breaking:** `sample-metrics` drops `--backfill-wayback` and `--import-csv`. GitHub's new star-history endpoint rebuilds every subject's curve directly, so neither workaround has anything left to recover.
- `sample-metrics` now rebuilds every GitHub subject's star curve from GitHub's star-history endpoint, one reading per week. It needs no token, so a tracked repository gets a curve complete from its first star, not only an administered one.
- `lint-repo` now reports labels a repository carries that no configured source declares, which `sync-labels` never deletes on its own.
- The bundled `repomatic-ship` skill now warns that `ruff -- check` fixes findings repo-wide where the config enables it, and recommends `--no-fix` for a read-only pass.
- The bundled `repomatic-ship` skill now checks hand-maintained blocks enumerating a registry, like a readme pasting a whole collection or a `mirror-src` diagram, which its version-sample rules did not reach.
- The bundled `babysit-ci` skill now caps a commit body at two lines and 25 words, and keeps diagnostic measurements out of it.

## [`7.15.0` (2026-09-07)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.14.0...v7.15.0)

- **Breaking:** the `manpages` release job now renders through `click-extra wrap --help-format man`. The `--man` flag it used no longer writes roff.
- **Breaking:** `show-test-matrix` now lists one row per job by default, and `--flat` is gone. Pass the new `--grid` for the compact two-axis pivot the command used to print.
- **Breaking:** `.claude/package-skills.sh` is gone. It packaged one ZIP per skill for the Claude Desktop **Customize > Skills** panel, which a plugin supersedes by carrying every skill and agent at once.
- **Deprecated:** `repomatic metadata` prints a deprecation warning and will be removed in `8.0.0`. Use `show-metadata`, which joins `show-config` and `show-test-matrix`.
- **Deprecated:** `repomatic workflow lint` prints a deprecation warning and will be removed in `8.0.0`. Use `lint-workflows`, a flat command replacing the `workflow` group.
- Add the `probe-workflow` skill: validate a claim about real-host behavior with a temporary GitHub Actions workflow, then retire it with its findings recorded in the retirement commit.
- `lint-repo` gains a `manpages-toolchain` check, warning when a project opting into man pages locks a `click-extra` its release job cannot render with.
- Add a `runner_arch` metadata key, mapping every runner label in the full test matrix to its CPU architecture.
- Render each command's worked examples in a dedicated `Examples` section of its help screen and man page, with the command lines highlighted.
- Options taking a project-specific value now validate it, list the choices in `--help` and complete them in the shell: `show-test-matrix`, `pr-body`, `pr-sync`, `update-dep-graph`, `ci-status` and `job-timings`.
- Help-screen sections regroup around a new "CI & runners" section, and each section now lists its subcommands alphabetically.
- Sharpen the one-line help descriptions of `show-metadata`, `prepare-release`, `lint-repo`, `run`, `fix-awesome-toc` and `cloudflare-pages`.
- `sync-runner-images` now rewrites a literal `runs-on:` as soon as a newer image supersedes it, instead of waiting for the old one to be deprecated.
- The `scan-virustotal` pull request is now titled `Update released binaries database`, with a one-line body replacing its scan-records commentary.
- Release blockers now carry a `Clears` countdown, in both the release pull request's alert and a new `lint-deps` column, each linking the pull request of the job that lifts it.
- The release pull request's `Squash and merge` alert drops from caution to warning, leaving caution for the blocker banner the release lane cannot catch in time.
- Trim the prose of the `bump-version`, `detect-squash-merge`, `prepare-release`, `sample-metrics`, `setup-guide-cloudflare-pages`, `setup-guide-token`, `sync-dep-sources` and `sync-runner-images` pull request templates.
- The Claude Code plugin marketplace now installs `.claude/` through a `git-subdir` source, which Claude Desktop and Cowork accept, and tracks the default branch so skill fixes land between releases. Adding the catalog at a tag still installs that release.
- The plugin manifest moved to `.claude/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, so `claude --plugin-dir .claude` loads the plugin straight from a checkout.
- Document the Intel macOS support policy: `macos-x64` binaries ship for as long as GitHub Actions offers an Intel runner image to build them.
- Illustrate the readme and docs with live captures: the CLI help screen, an animated `sync-deps --dry-run` session, the test-matrix grid and a configuration example.
- Raise the `click-extra` floor to `9`, required by the new `Examples` help sections and the `manpages` release job.
- Bump Nuitka from `4.1.3` to `4.2`.
- Fix uv's resolution summary scribbling over the `sync-deps` progress trail.
- Fix `repomatic run` printing a Python traceback for an unknown tool name. It is now a usage error listing every registered tool.
- Fix the `plugin` component rewriting a settings file `format-json` had already settled, which kept `sync-repomatic` and the autofix lane undoing each other. The wiring now compares the parsed document, not its text.
- Fix the generated `release.yaml` ending on a stray blank line, alone among the workflow callers.
- Fix `lint-repo` asking for GitHub topics a project already declares: topics now match `[project] keywords` case-insensitively, since GitHub lowercases every topic it stores.
- Fix `sync-runner-images` proposing a probe for a runner image the repository already runs, which marked every test-matrix cell on that image `continue-on-error`.
- Fix `run {tool} --verify` crashing with a `FileExistsError` on a path resolving to the working directory, which now verifies the tool's own default file set.
- The bundled `babysit-ci`, `probe-workflow` and `repomatic-ship` skills now read CI runs through the GitHub API, after `gh run list` reported month-old runs as the newest.
- Fix stale references in the bundled `babysit-ci`, `repomatic-audit`, `repomatic-changelog`, `repomatic-ship` and `repomatic-test-matrix` skills: dangling `claude.md` pointers, a retired `lychee.toml` path, an inverted binary-build condition and stale workflow names.
- The bundled `file-bug-report` skill now states when a GitHub permalink renders as a code snippet, and how to read a line range off the commit it pins.
- The bundled `babysit-ci` and `repomatic-ship` skills now treat a wall-clock budget failing on a shared runner as a test defect to fix, not transient infra to re-run.
- The bundled `repomatic-ship` skill now warns that `actionlint` and `zizmor` can contradict each other, and says how to settle a conflict between them.
- Document the mdformat defect that silently deletes a backtick code span inside a Markdown image's alt-text.

## [`7.14.0` (2026-08-27)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.13.0...v7.14.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.14.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.14.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.14.0).

- **Breaking:** the `agent` component is gone, with the `agent.location` config key and the bundled `claude.md` reference document. `repomatic init` no longer writes to a repository's instructions file, which each repository now owns outright.
- **Breaking:** `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is gone: the account derives from `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` alone. `cloudflare-pages --account-id` and `lint-repo --has-cloudflare-account-id` are removed with it.
- **Breaking:** the `debug.yaml` workflow is now opt-in, gated by a new `[tool.repomatic] debug.sync` key. A repository already carrying it keeps it by setting `debug.sync = true`.
- **Breaking:** the `arch` field of `repomatic metadata`'s `build_targets` and `nuitka_matrix` output now reads `x86_64` and `aarch64`, not `x64` and `arm64`. Update any workflow branching on `matrix.arch`.
- **Breaking:** `build_targets` and `nuitka_matrix` replace the `glibc_floor` and `min_os` keys with a single `floor`, holding the same versions. A workflow reading `matrix.min_os` needs `matrix.floor`.
- `lint-repo` gains two checks: `setup-uv-checksum-coverage`, warning when CI installs the pinned uv unverified, and `classic-branch-protection`, reporting a branch protection rule left beside a ruleset.
- `show-test-matrix` gains `--row-axis`, `--col-axis` and `--flat`, laying the grid out on any job key the matrix carries or listing one row per job.
- `show-test-matrix` states how many jobs a cell stands for (`✅ stable ×5`), and sorts its Python rows by release instead of job order.
- `scan-virustotal` and `sample-metrics` publish through one long-lived pull request that each run appends to, instead of committing to the default branch. No file-modifying job pushes there any more.
- Both gain `--carry-from`, restoring the store from a remote branch first, so records pending in an open pull request are appended to rather than dropped.
- `sample-metrics` names the phase (`forward`, `reconstruct`, `import` or `wayback`) in a new column of its report table, so one subject reads as one outcome per phase.
- `cloudflare-pages --create` is now idempotent: an existing Pages project is reused and reconciled against the declared settings, instead of failing on the API's `409` duplicate-name refusal.
- The Todo list documentation page lists the project's pending work: each deferred change is written as a `todo` admonition beside the code or prose it acts on.
- The `repomatic-ship` skill now sweeps those admonitions: pending work the cycle introduced is written as one, and a todo whose upstream trigger fired is retired with the shim it guards.
- `metadata` and every glob-driven check now walk the repository tree once and skip `.git/`, instead of re-walking it on every lookup.
- `ci-status` locates every workflow's newest run through one branch-wide listing instead of one query per workflow.
- Every HTTP fetch now identifies itself with a `repomatic/{version}` user agent.
- `sync-workflow-pins` no longer bumps the uv pin past what the pinned `astral-sh/setup-uv` can checksum-verify: the action silently skips validation for a version its bundled table does not list.
- `show-config` wraps its widest columns instead of running past 240 characters. A format unable to hold a wrapped cell, like `github` or `csv`, stays unwrapped.
- `list-skills` renders a table honoring `--table-format`, replacing the hand-padded lines that ran to 500 characters.
- `sync-runner-images` takes `--live` like every other command with a dry-run mode, replacing its odd `--no-dry-run` spelling.
- Dependency-update pull requests no longer list yanked or pre-release versions in their intermediate release notes.
- The bundled `[tool.typos]` config no longer checks SVG content: a terminal capture splits words across `<text>` runs, so correcting a fragment corrupts the image.
- The `lint-repo` stale gh-pages check now passes only on a confirmed `404`: any other API failure reports as skipped instead of green.
- Fix `lint-repo` flagging every `test-matrix.exclude` entry as stale on a `full-include` matrix, and the finding now names the missing axis values.
- Fix `lint-deps` missing a dependency floor declared with `>` when checking floors against the cooldown window.
- Fix `lint-deps` asking an aggregate extra selecting the project's own extras for a version floor, which a project can never declare on itself.
- Fix `metadata` leaving the checkout on a past commit with changes stashed when a mid-scan git command fails.
- Fix the `sample-metrics` chart crashing on a series whose peak is `0` or `1`.
- Fix `sample-metrics` abandoning the tail of a sampling pass to GitHub's secondary rate limit: the `gh` plumbing now retries the refusal on a bounded backoff.
- `sample-metrics --backfill-wayback` gives up after ten consecutive refusals and reports to retry later, instead of spending every remaining capture's retry schedule against an exhausted per-IP budget.
- Fix `show-test-matrix` leaving a cell bare when several jobs share it: every state of a `stable, unstable` cell now carries its own glyph.
- Fix the `plugin` component writing tab-indented settings into a repository whose Biome config asks for spaces, which had `sync-repomatic` and `format-json` fighting each other. The indent now follows that config.
- Fix `init` leaving behind the folder of a removed skill whose `SKILL.md` was already gone: the tombstone addresses the file, so an empty folder outlived every later run.
- Fix `format-images` dropping its optimization summary table from the PR body, lost in `7.11.0` when its two PR-publishing steps collapsed into one.
- The skills, subagents and plugin documentation pages group under an Agent tooling section and move to `/agent-skills`, `/subagents` and `/claude-code-plugin`, with the old URLs redirecting.
- The generated API reference moves off the guide pages and splits one page per module (`/repomatic.awesome_toc`), instead of stacking a whole package onto one page. The guide pages keep their prose and link to it.
- The Python compatibility table of the install page marks a version a release neither declared nor excluded with `–`, instead of counting it as unsupported.
- The `commit-messages` page and the bundled skills now hold a commit body to three cases: bundled orthogonal work, a link to a public record, or a `Closes #N` pointer.
- Fix the `exclude` example of the configuration page naming `zizmor`, which is not a component: copying it made `repomatic init` fail.
- Fix stale guidance in the bundled skills: two module pointers the regroup broke, the scan history now published through a pull request, and a retired upstream contribution target.
- Fix the dead `claude.md` section cross-references the bundled skills and subagents carried, and guard against new ones.
- Sphinx linkcheck no longer reports every release-asset download URL as broken: `conf.py` withholds its github.com credential from those URLs, which GitHub redirects to a host that answers 401.
- Fix the dead links on the install and operation-contracts pages, and the API reference documenting every regrouped module twice.

## [`7.13.0` (2026-08-17)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.12.1...v7.13.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.13.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.13.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.13.0).

- **Breaking:** the `agents` component is renamed `subagents`, its config key `agents.location` becoming `subagents.location`. Naming the old component in `[tool.repomatic] include` or `exclude` fails the init; the old config key is ignored with a warning.
- **Breaking:** `repomatic init claude` is renamed `repomatic init agent`, and its destination follows `[tool.repomatic] agent.location` (defaulting per `[tool.repomatic.flavor] agent`) rather than a fixed root-level `claude.md`, reaching instructions kept as `AGENTS.md` or outside the root.
- **Breaking:** the `runner-images` command, its workflow job and its `[tool.repomatic] runner-images` config key are gone, along with the issue they maintained; `sync-runner-images` closes that issue on its first run.
- **Breaking:** the Cloudflare Pages deploy needs only `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: a token scoped to `Cloudflare Pages: Edit` resolves its own account, so `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` becomes an override for a credential spanning several accounts; `cloudflare-pages --account-id` prints the identifier for that case.
- **Breaking:** the VirusTotal scan history moves from `docs/assets/virustotal-scans.json` to `virustotal-scans.csv`. The first `scan-virustotal` run after upgrading converts the old JSON on its own; delete the stale `.json` afterwards.
- New `[tool.repomatic] site.deploy` config choosing where the built site publishes: `github-pages`, the default, or `cloudflare-pages` through `wrangler pages deploy`, with `site.cloudflare-project` naming a Pages project that predates the repository.
- New `cloudflare-pages` command reconciling the live Pages project against the declared `site.*` state: `--check`, `--apply`, `--dump`, and `--create` for rebuilding from nothing. Warns a month before the API token expires, which Cloudflare never signals.
- New `cloudflare-pages --attach-domain` serving a project at a custom domain, creating the proxied `CNAME` record the bare API leaves missing.
- New `cloudflare-config-drift` job in the Docs workflow running that check apart from the deploy, so drift is loud without holding up publishing.
- `lint-repo` now fails a committed `_redirects` file that would lose rules to the Cloudflare Pages engine's silent budget accounting, naming each URL a dropped rule leaves dead or silently misredirected.
- `lint-repo` now warns when `wrangler.toml` contradicts the declared Cloudflare Pages project name or compatibility date, and checks a migrated site keeps its GitHub Pages custom domain pointing at the new host so published `github.io` URLs keep redirecting.
- The Cloudflare deploy job now drops files over Direct Upload's 25 MiB per-file limit, naming each in the log, instead of failing the whole upload on the first one.
- The Docs workflow now runs monthly, mirrored into downstream callers: a lapsed Cloudflare token becomes a red run, and link rot surfaces between pushes.
- The Docs workflow no longer publishes Sphinx's parse cache: doctrees now build in the runner's temp directory instead of riding the Pages upload, 118 MB of a 182 MB artifact on an autodoc-heavy project.
- Every setup guide step is rewritten to the actions it asks for; the guide and `lint-repo` now ask about whichever host `site.deploy` names, and the Cloudflare step hands out a pre-filled account-owned token form.
- New `sample-metrics` command recording what forges say about the repositories a project tracks into one committed CSV: star count, newest release or tag, and newest commit, read from GitHub, GitLab and Forgejo instances.
- `sample-metrics` renders the accumulated history as themeable SVG charts, replacing the star-history embeds GitHub's 2026 stargazer restriction broke. Star history recovers from per-star timestamps, archived pages with `--backfill-wayback`, or a star-history.com export with `--import-csv`.
- New `[tool.repomatic.metrics] charts` option `scale = "logarithmic"`, measuring the vertical axis in powers of ten so series orders of magnitude apart stay legible on one chart.
- New opt-in `metrics.yaml` workflow running the sampler weekly and committing its store. Enable with `[tool.repomatic] metrics.sync = true` and declare the repositories to follow in `[tool.repomatic.metrics] subjects`.
- New `sync-runner-images` command and weekly job opening a pull request that moves a deprecated runner image onto its successor, or probes a strictly newer one as `continue-on-error`. Decline a proposal for good with `[tool.repomatic.sync-runner-images] ignore`.
- New `job-timings` command reporting median whole-job wall-clock per runner image, read from recent successful runs.
- `lint-deps` now warns about a dependency floor comment running past `[tool.repomatic] lint-deps.comment-word-threshold` words, 40 by default.
- New `lint-anchors` command checking every authored same-page fragment link against the anchors the built site actually carries, run by the Docs workflow before each deploy.
- New `pr-body` and `pr-sync` option `--template-arg-file KEY=PATH`, reading a template value from a file for a value with no ceiling on its size.
- New `git-commit-push` option `--all-changes`, staging everything the working tree carries instead of a named path list.
- New bundled `repomatic-test-matrix` skill deciding which Python versions, operating systems and runner images earn a test-matrix cell.
- Bundled guidance moves its release-repair, label-retirement and test-matrix procedures out of `claude.md` and into the skills that run them, leaving the always-loaded file carrying rules rather than checklists.
- The bundled `repomatic-ship` skill now names all three shapes an unanswered hardware-key signing prompt produces, treating a silent hang as a missed prompt rather than a slow command.
- The bundled `sphinx-docs` agent's page roster gains the `plugin`, `commit-messages` and `history` pages.
- The release PR's unshippable-dependency warning is now a single line naming each package, each linked to the line declaring it, instead of a paragraph and a four-column table.
- The binaries catalog now leaves the VirusTotal cell empty unless a scan record backs it, instead of linking every binary to an analysis page that was never created.
- The bundled `[tool.typos]` config now accepts `PNGs` and `PATCHed`, which typos otherwise splits and rewrites to `ONGs` and `PATCHead`.
- `repomatic init` no longer drops the comment documenting a bundled template's first key: six of the nine templates were losing their opening comment, the `[tool.typos]` proper-noun map among them.
- Fix `ci-status --help` collapsing everything after its first example into one garbled line.
- `update-dep-graph` now reads the root's direct dependencies from `uv.lock`: uv's SBOM export promoted a dependency-group package to a primary dependency whenever an extra pulled it in transitively.
- New Cloudflare Pages documentation page covering Direct Upload, token scoping and rotation, the drift check, and the redirects engine's undocumented accounting. It opens on a runbook taking a bare domain name to a published site in seven commands.
- This project's documentation moves to [repomatic.net](https://repomatic.net), and its links move with it: every reference now names the extensionless URL Cloudflare Pages serves. The old `kdeldycke.github.io/repomatic` addresses keep redirecting.

## [`7.12.1` (2026-08-15)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.12.0...v7.12.1)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.12.1` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.12.1/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.12.1).

- New `[tool.repomatic] sphinx.builder` config choosing the Sphinx builder the Docs workflow deploys, so a project can publish extension-less URLs with `dirhtml`.
- The bundled `repomatic-ship` skill now reads a green CI run as stale when supersession cancelled every run between it and `HEAD`, and ships a release's own reflection findings in that same release.
- Bundled guidance now requires a duration baseline and per-job timestamps before calling a CI run hung, and `repomatic-ship` no longer holds a green release waiting for a binary build.
- Fix stale guidance in the bundled agents and skills: the `update-docs` job credited to the wrong workflow, Furo logo and OpenGraph settings contradicting a working configuration, and a `repomatic` invocation that fails outside the canonical repository.
- New `repomatic init claude` component projecting the audience-tagged sections of the bundled `claude.md` into a repository, leaving every section that repository wrote for itself untouched.
- Bundled guidance now declares which repositories each `claude.md` section applies to, and documents what a repository consuming repomatic owns: its workflow content, its pin, and its configuration.
- The bundled `repomatic-audit` skill now reads those tags to tell a synced section from a repository's own, instead of classifying each one by hand.
- Fix two stale claims in the bundled guidance: the workflow permissions contract is generated rather than hand-written, and PAT-gated `lint-repo` checks report as skipped rather than failing the job.

## [`7.12.0` (2026-08-14)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.11.0...v7.12.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.12.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.12.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.12.0).

- New `ci-status` command reporting each workflow's latest run and which of its failing jobs gate a merge, read from jobs rather than run conclusions.
- New `repomatic run <tool> --verify` reporting which files a formatter would rewrite, without touching the working tree.
- `repomatic run` now resolves a tool's targets itself when given no arguments, and skips a tool with no matching file instead of invoking it pathless.
- New repeatable `pr-sync --add-path` option limiting what the pull request commits to a git pathspec list.
- `lint-deps` now warns about declarations departing from version policy: upper bounds, missing floors, unsorted lists, misplaced type stubs, uncommented floors. Disabled with `--no-policy`.
- `lint-deps` now names the `lint-deps.allow` exemption in the remedy it prints for a git source.
- `sync-workflow-pins` now backfills a missing `--exclude-newer-package` exemption on a run that moves no version, instead of computing the splice and discarding it.
- `lint-repo` now fails when an inline upstream pin resolving under a cooldown carries no `--exclude-newer-package` exemption, which takes every `needs: metadata` job down with it.
- `lint-repo` now warns when an `astral-sh/setup-uv` step declares no `version:` input, or when steps across the repository pin more than one uv version.
- `lint-repo` now fails, and `repomatic init` now warns, when a workflow asks `repomatic metadata` for a key that no longer exists.
- `lint-repo` now warns when a Sphinx project's GitHub website field differs from the documentation URL declared in `[project.urls]`.
- `lint-changelog` now warns about a released section holding no entry.
- `runner-images` now watches every image the workflows name literally, not just the curated test axes.
- A bare `repomatic init` now re-syncs a tool config the repository already carries, so `[tool.typos]`, `[tool.uv]` and `[tool.bumpversion]` follow the bundled template once adopted.
- Every job now caps its runtime with `timeout-minutes`, so a hung job frees its runner in minutes instead of the platform's 6-hour ceiling. Downstream callers inherit the caps.
- The Docs workflow now triggers on `readme.*.md`, so a push touching only a translated readme no longer skips link checking.
- `repomatic run actionlint` now ships a bundled config declaring the `ubuntu-26.04` runner labels actionlint `1.7.12` predates.
- The bundled `lychee.toml` now excludes `bitdefender.com`, `npmjs.com`, `star-history.com` and `githubstatus.com`, which answer bots with 403, 405 or JavaScript rather than a link.
- `cancel-runs` now spares a run whose head commit carries `[changelog] Release`, so a sweep of the default branch cannot kill a release matrix.
- Fix `gh` re-downloading on every command instead of once per version: a binary nested in an archive subdirectory was stored under one cache key and looked up under another.
- Fix `repomatic init` realigning a workflow's inline `repomatic==X.Y.Z` pin without the cooldown exemption beside it, leaving a command that cannot resolve the version just written.
- Fix `audit --fix` dirtying `uv.lock` with a cooldown-override record when no upgrade was reachable, which opened a `fix-vulnerable-deps` pull request carrying no fix.
- Fix `repomatic init` restyling a locally added array item when it re-syncs a tool config, which had `sync-repomatic` and `format-pyproject` endlessly opening pull requests undoing each other.
- A formatter exiting with its rewrite status while leaving every target unchanged is now reported as a crash, instead of passing for a successful reformat that never happened.
- Fix stale guidance across the bundled skills: wrong `[tool.repomatic.workflow]` key names, wrong workflow and job names for `lint-deps` and `lint-changelog`, which tools a bundled default actually covers, and downstream audits comparing against `main` rather than the adopted release.
- Fix the bundled `babysit-ci` skill classifying a CI job by a leading `✅`, which dropped every required job whose name carries no stability glyph from the failures it collects.

## [`7.11.0` (2026-08-13)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.10.0...v7.11.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.11.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.11.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.11.0).

- **Breaking:** `labels.content-rules` and `labels.file-rules` are now tables mapping each label to its patterns, like `"📚 docs" = ["docs/**"]`. The array-of-tables form and its `actions/labeler` v5 matcher schema are gone; an un-migrated config is ignored with a warning.
- **Breaking:** the `file-labeller` and `content-labeller` jobs merged into a single `apply-labels` job. Update any required check or `needs:` edge naming them.
- **Breaking:** `repomatic init` and `repomatic workflow lint` take `--upstream-repo` for the upstream toolkit; `--repo` now means the `owner/name` slug everywhere, including on `sync-labels`.
- New `pr-sync` command replacing `peter-evans/create-pull-request` in every job: opens, refreshes or retires an automation PR from one `--template` flag. Its PR closes even when the job's `if:` gate skips the rest of the step.
- New `lock-threads` command replacing `dessant/lock-threads` in the autolock job. It skips threads carrying the `🤖 ci` label, so an issue repomatic maintains is no longer locked out of reopening when its condition recurs.
- New `apply-labels` command replacing `actions/labeler` and `github/issue-labeler` in the labeller job. A rule's entry overrides the bundled default for that label, and an empty list disables it.
- The debug job's context dump no longer runs `crazy-max/ghaction-dump-context`, and no longer installs `cgroup-tools` and `cpuid` to read them. It now reports the kernel, disk, CPU and memory of every runner using only what the image already ships.
- A bare content pattern is now a keyword, matched case-insensitively on word boundaries, so `"🐛 bug" = ["bug", "error"]` works as written; the `/…/flags` form passes a regex through. Keyword lists used to be AND-joined and never fired.
- `repomatic init labels` no longer writes `.github/labeller-content-based.yaml` or `.github/labeller-file-based.yaml`: the default rules live in the package, and `repomatic init` now prunes an unmodified committed copy automatically. Move customizations to `[tool.repomatic.labels]`; a hand-edited copy is left for review instead of deleted.
- The `sponsor-label` command now applies the `💖 sponsor` label the registry defines, instead of a plural variant that exists in no repository and failed every labelling attempt.
- `pr-sync` now clears a conversation lock standing in the way of retiring a stale automation PR, instead of dying on the refused close comment.
- `sync-labels` now hands labelmaker the canonical token (`REPOMATIC_PAT`, then `GH_TOKEN`, then `GITHUB_TOKEN`), so an environment carrying only the PAT syncs authenticated.
- Every re-lock (`sync-dep-sources`, `audit --fix`) now passes the project's own `[tool.uv] exclude-newer` explicitly, so CI's ambient `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` can no longer retime the lock.
- `lint-repo` now runs the branch-ruleset and immutable-releases checks it already defined but never invoked.
- `apply-labels` no longer applies `💖 sponsor` from the words "funding" or "sponsor", or from a pull request touching `.github/funding.yml`: only `sponsor-label` sets it, from actual sponsorship.
- Every `gh` call now runs the registry-pinned, checksum-verified binary, falling back to `$PATH` with a warning when it cannot be installed.
- Test jobs running an unreleased Python are now titled `py3.15-dev`, so a `continue-on-error` cell states why it is allowed to fail.

## [`7.10.0` (2026-08-12)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.9.0...v7.10.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.10.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.10.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.10.0).

- **Breaking:** the `update-dep-graph` job moved from `autofix.yaml` into the release engine, its only firing moment being a release push. A required check or `needs:` edge naming it under Autofix must follow.
- **Breaking:** manual version-bump commits now read `` [changelog] Bump minor version to `vX.Y.0` ``: every version-machinery commit carries the `[changelog] ` prefix, and anything matching the old unprefixed titles must follow.
- **Breaking:** the default test matrix moved to `ubuntu-26.04-arm` and `ubuntu-26.04`, retiring `ubuntu-slim`: every job now runs on a test-matrix runner. Pin the old images back with `test-matrix.replace.os = { "ubuntu-26.04-arm" = "ubuntu-24.04-arm" }`.
- **Breaking:** a report emitted with `--output-format github-actions` now travels as a file: the step output is named `<key>_file` and holds a path, so a large report reaches a PR body intact. A workflow reading `steps.<id>.outputs.diff_table` must read `.diff_table_file` instead.
- New `lint-deps` command and release-lane job, blocking a release whose dependencies do not all resolve from PyPI: git branches, forks, local paths, direct URLs and private indexes. Exempt a package with `[tool.repomatic] lint-deps.allow`.
- New `runner-images` job and CLI command, opening an issue that lists GitHub's open runner-image announcements and flags the ones retiring an image the repo runs on. Opt out with `runner-images = false`.
- New `is_python_package` metadata key. `sync-bumpversion` now gates on it instead of `is_python_project`, so the job no longer opens `[tool.bumpversion]` PRs against a uv virtual project (`[tool.uv] package = false`).
- New `--prefix-file` option on `pr-body`, and a matching `GHA_PR_BODY_PREFIX_FILE` variable, reading the body prefix from a file.
- Autofix jobs no longer run on version-bump pushes, which only re-checked machine-generated commits; drift stays covered by the next push and the weekly sweep.
- `repomatic init` no longer writes the running version's workflow content beside a pin the cooldown held back: a repository that already carries workflows keeps them untouched until the release is adopted.
- The `repomatic-ship` skill now reconciles bundled skills and agents as a third pass, judges a false-positive autofix PR against current `main`, and distinguishes a superseded intra-cycle measurement from a genuine contradiction.
- macOS Nuitka builds now hit their compile cache: ccache hashes paths relative to the runner root (`base_dir`), so uv's randomly-named cache path no longer changes the hashed compiler arguments every run.
- The tool runner now retries a download up to 3 times on transient network failures, instead of failing the job on a one-off TLS or truncation error.
- Standalone binary tests now run for every healthy target when a sibling build fails, instead of being skipped wholesale.
- Oversized step outputs are trimmed instead of killing the step that reads them with `Argument list too long`.
- The setup guide issue now reopens when Actions SHA pinning is turned off, instead of closing while reporting every repository setting complete.

## [`7.9.0` (2026-08-10)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.8.0...v7.9.0)

> [!WARNING]
> The `windows-x64` binary shipped without its `.attestation.json` sidecar: a transient TLS failure on the runner skipped the upload, and immutable releases lock the asset list. The attestation itself is registered, so `gh attestation verify repomatic-7.9.0-windows-x64.exe --repo kdeldycke/repomatic` still verifies against GitHub's attestation service.

> [!NOTE]
> `7.9.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.9.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.9.0).

- **Breaking:** `REPOMATIC_PAT` now requires `Administration: Read-only`, and `lint-repo` fails without it. Regenerate the token with the setup guide's pre-filled link; steps that cannot be verified now say so instead of vanishing.
- New `[tool.repomatic] nuitka.dev-targets` option: an ordinary push now compiles binaries only for a canary subset, `["linux-arm64"]` by default. Release commits, a new weekly schedule and manual dispatches build the full 6-target fleet.
- `lint-repo` now also verifies versionless `releases/latest/download` URLs in `docs/install.md`, catching a renamed asset that leaves the guide pointing at a 404.
- `sync-workflow-pins` now walks `npx pkg@1.2.3` version literals forward, not just `npm install` and `uvx` pins.
- `repomatic init` now realigns a workflow's inline `repomatic==X.Y.Z` literal onto the pin it writes into the `uses:` refs, in either direction.
- Nuitka compile caches now persist across runs, so a warm build skips most of the C compilation. Release commits and macOS builds opt out, so no published binary is influenced by cached objects.
- Compile, binary-test and VirusTotal-scan jobs now carry execution timeouts, so a hung job frees its runner slot instead of squatting it for 6 hours.
- Scheduled and manually dispatched release runs get their own concurrency group, so a later push no longer cancels them mid-build.
- Binary self-tests on non-release pushes now run inside the compile job; the standalone per-target test jobs run on release commits only.
- `sync-gitignore` no longer discards rules added by hand to the committed `.gitignore`: it refuses to write when the rebuild would lose one, naming the rules. New `--drop-orphans` flag confirms an intended loss.
- The setup guide no longer asks a uv virtual project to register a PyPI Trusted Publisher, and `lint-repo` no longer checks one: both now gate on whether the project builds a distributable.
- Fix the broken-links issue never being filed: `docs.yaml` ran lychee through `xargs`, which reported its "broken links found" exit status as a crash.
- A `Bad credentials` 401 now fails immediately instead of retrying a token that cannot recover, so a revoked `REPOMATIC_PAT` reports itself plainly rather than as a chain of unrelated check failures.
- New [Nuitka compilation guide](https://kdeldycke.github.io/repomatic/nuitka.html) covering build targets, fleet cadence, compile caching, the LTO stance, and upstream workarounds.
- New *Build backends* section in the packaging guide, covering the `[tool.setuptools]` package-discovery shim a distribution needs when it builds a `uv-build` project with setuptools.
- The documentation sidebar logo now follows Furo's light and dark toggle, so the wordmark no longer renders near-black against the dark theme.

## [`7.8.0` (2026-08-09)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.7.0...v7.8.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.8.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.8.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.8.0).

- **Breaking:** the Codecov integration is removed, along with the `codecov` component, its `.github/codecov.yaml`, and the `coverage_cells` metadata key. `repomatic init` prunes an untouched orphaned config; delete the `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret and coverage badge by hand.
- **Breaking:** attestation bundles now carry the full filename of the asset they attest, so `repomatic-manpages.attestation.json` becomes `repomatic-manpages.tar.gz.attestation.json`. A repository declaring one extra asset gets `<filename>.attestation.json` in place of `<package-name>-extra-assets.attestation.json`.
- New `pack-attestation` command names an attestation bundle after the asset it attests and prints the release upload list.
- New `coverage` component: `repomatic init coverage` writes a `[tool.coverage]` section carrying branch coverage, report precision and a `report.fail_under` ratchet, shipped disabled.
- `lint-repo` now warns when a release download URL in `docs/install.md` names a file its release does not carry.
- The bundled pytest config drops `--cov-branch` and `--cov-precision` from `addopts`, now carried by the `coverage` component. Existing `[tool.pytest]` sections are left alone; run `repomatic init coverage` to pick the settings back up.
- The release lane's `publish-release` job now checks out the repository, so uploading binaries to the release no longer fails with `Failed to spawn: repomatic`. `7.7.0` shipped with no standalone executables because of it.
- `lint-changelog` re-confirms a release live before dropping its availability admonition, so a day-old cache no longer reports a just-published version as missing.
- The readme's logo is now an absolute URL, so it renders on the PyPI project page instead of 404ing.
- The install guide's executable table points at the last release that carries binaries, instead of a version whose upload lane failed.

## [`7.7.0` (2026-08-09)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.6.0...v7.7.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.7.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.7.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.7.0).

- **Breaking:** drop the `check-version` command: nothing invoked it, and workflows read the `minor_bump_allowed` and `major_bump_allowed` metadata keys instead.
- **Breaking:** drop the `clean-unmodified-configs` command, superseded by `repomatic init --delete-unmodified`.
- **Breaking:** `repomatic metadata` no longer emits the `toml_files`, `changelog_bullet_word_threshold`, `nuitka_enabled` and `nuitka_nofollow_imports` keys. No workflow consumed them; the three config fields are read directly by their subcommands.
- New `github-housekeeping` skill backfills and curates labels and milestones across a repository's full issue and PR history: taxonomy design, cache-backed bulk classification with review gates, AI-slop detection from closed-without-comment signals, and milestone assignment by changelog, git-tag, and release-date archaeology.
- New `pack-binaries` command materializes the versionless binary aliases and prints the release upload list, replacing the release engine's shell loop: the asset naming convention now has one Python definition, shared with the install-guide freeze.
- New `--default-branch` option on the `changelog` command, so a repository whose default branch is not `main` gets a comparison URL that round-trips through the release freeze.
- `init` no longer writes the release lane (`changelog.md`, `changelog.yaml`, `release.yaml`, the PyPI publish action) into a uv virtual project (`[tool.uv] package = false`). Dependency locking, coverage and test tooling still apply.
- `init` now lists each `awesome-template` file it writes instead of one summary line, and `init labels` no longer reports its regenerated files as unmodified configs to clean up.
- Rename the Claude Code plugin release asset to `repomatic-claude-plugin.zip`, as `repomatic-plugin.zip` read as a plugin for repomatic. `/plugin install` is unaffected.
- Attestation bundles are now named after the asset they cover (`repomatic-manpages.attestation.json`) rather than the job that produced them, so the eight binary bundles no longer overwrite each other down to a single file.
- The VirusTotal detections chart now pins its CDN script with a Subresource Integrity digest, so a tampered copy is refused by the browser.
- `sync-workflow-pins` now splices the `--exclude-newer-package` cooldown exemption beside the inline `repomatic==X.Y.Z` pin it realigns, in the single spelling the release freeze writes and the post-release unfreeze recognizes.
- The changelog's `[!CAUTION]` admonition for a yanked release now quotes the reason PyPI recorded for the yank, when there is one.
- Changelog links are discovered under any capitalization of the PyPI `project_urls` key, matching how source URLs were already resolved.
- PyPI release lookups order same-day publications by PEP 440, so `1.10.0` is no longer ranked below `1.9.0`.
- Dependency-update PR bodies omit the version comparison link when the upstream repository publishes no matching tags, instead of linking to a 404.
- `format-images` now installs and verifies its `oxipng` binary once per run instead of once per optimized image.
- Registry binary downloads and `update-checksums` now carry a stall timeout, and `update-checksums` rejects truncated bodies instead of recording their digest as the new canonical checksum.
- GitHub token validation now times out instead of hanging forever when the API is unreachable.
- The `zsh_files` metadata key now lists only shell scripts whose shebang names zsh, so a bash `.sh` file is no longer linted as Zsh.
- `repomatic metadata` no longer aborts on a src-layout project: a Nuitka entry point with no module file at the repository root is skipped with a warning.
- `lint-repo` now reports an unreadable rulesets API as a skipped branch-protection check rather than a failed one.
- The broken-links issue no longer claims broken links when lychee itself failed to run.
- The release freeze now warns when it finds no changelog section for the version being released, instead of silently doing nothing.
- `lint-changelog --fix` now exits non-zero when it could not repair every problem it reported, instead of reporting success as soon as any one fix landed.
- `lint-changelog --fix` no longer stamps an undatable orphaned version with a `0000-00-00` placeholder date, and files a datable one in order even when every existing heading is a `.devN` development section.
- `sync-uv-lock` parses `uv.lock` once per phase instead of once per lookup, cutting several hundred milliseconds off each run.
- Fix downstream tool caches frozen at their first write: the reusable workflows' cache keys hashed a file that only exists upstream. Keys now rotate with the reusable workflow's own commit SHA.
- Fix `init` misreading a thin caller's trailing comment or odd-indented job line as extra downstream jobs, which silently flipped the file onto the explicit-permissions contract or duplicated the managed job's tail below the regenerated lanes.
- Fix `init` mishandling a consumer's extra release jobs: the extra `needs:` edges declared on the `release` lane were dropped, and a blank line accumulated above the jobs on every sync.
- Fix `init --output-dir` scanning the current directory for unmodified configs, which made `--delete-unmodified` act on the wrong tree.
- Fix the generated `release.yaml` emitting a bare `needs:` (which GitHub rejects at startup) when every canonical edge is filtered out.
- Fix a `[tool.repomatic.workflow] paths` override emitting entries like `**/*.py` unquoted when the canonical block held no quoted entry to copy, which parsed as a YAML alias and left the workflow silently ignored.
- Fix `repomatic metadata` crashing on a repository carrying a tag the version parser refuses, like `v1.2.3_hotfix`.
- Fix `sync-action-pins` and `sync-workflow-pins` silently reverting each other's edits when one `sync-deps` run bumps both kinds of pin in the same workflow file.
- Fix a mid-resolve failure of `sync-uv-lock` leaving synced policy pins beside a stale lockfile for the CI job to commit: the project is now restored to its pre-run state on any error.
- Fix `sync-mailmap` crashing with `UnboundLocalError` on a repository that has no `.mailmap` yet, the exact bootstrap its default `--create-if-missing` advertises.
- Fix the sponsor labeller treating an empty `pull_request` event payload as a pull request.
- Fix issue-filing jobs failing to record a new issue when `gh` prints a notice above the issue URL.
- Fix `update-dep-graph` failing on Windows when a dependency's SBOM metadata contains non-ASCII characters.
- Fix `cache clean` scoping: `--namespace` no longer wipes binaries and tool configs, `--tool` no longer wipes HTTP responses, and `--max-age` now applies to cached configs instead of deleting them all.
- Fix `repomatic run mypy` aborting with `Unable to find lockfile` in a repository without a `uv.lock`: the tool now runs in an isolated, cooldown-gated environment when there is no lockfile to freeze.
- Fix binary tools executing a just-deleted staging copy when the cache write is lost (Docker overlay runners) or the cache root is unwritable: the fallback copy now survives for the whole process.
- Fix the published plugin manifest declaring the post-release `.devN` version rather than the release it ships with.
- Fix image optimization leaving a `.bak` file in the working tree when interrupted.

## [`7.6.0` (2026-08-08)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.5.0...v7.6.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.6.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.6.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.6.0).

- **Breaking:** the `labels` component is now ephemeral: `labels.toml` and the two labeller YAMLs are staged only when named explicitly (`repomatic init labels`). A repository that committed them sees them reported as excluded files on disk, removable with `init --delete-excluded`.
- New `fix-awesome-toc` command deletes the table-of-contents entries awesome-lint forbids from `readme.md` and every `readme.{lang}.md` beside it, matching translated sections by position rather than by their English name.
- The bundled skills and agents are now published as a Claude Code plugin: `/plugin marketplace add kdeldycke/repomatic` then `/plugin install repomatic@kdeldycke`. Needs Claude Code 2.1.224 or later. Addresses [#2378](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/issues/2378).
- New `pack-plugin` command builds the attested `repomatic-plugin.zip` asset every GitHub release now carries, with the marketplace URL pinned to the release tag.
- New `init plugin` component merges the plugin's marketplace and enablement keys into a repository's `.claude/settings.json`, leaving every other setting untouched. New `[tool.repomatic] settings.location` moves the destination.
- `lint-repo` now checks a repository's own `pr-body --template-file` templates: they belong in `.github/pr-templates/`, must exist, and must carry a `title` and a bare `footer: false`.
- A failed `extra-assets` job now leaves the GitHub release as a draft instead of publishing it without the declared assets. A skipped job still publishes, so repositories declaring no extra assets are unaffected.
- `sync-labels` now exports to a scratch directory instead of the repository root, so it no longer leaves three untracked files behind. Both committed and downloaded `extra-labels/` files are applied, a download shadowing a committed file of the same name.
- The generated downstream `release.yaml` now carries the canonical deny-by-default `permissions: {}`, so a consumer job appended below the managed lanes no longer runs with the repository's default token scopes.
- The generated `release.yaml` keeps the extra `needs:` edges a consumer declares on its `release` lane, so a caller-side asset build can gate the engine. Edges naming a managed lane, a vanished job, or an upstream-only job are still dropped.
- Fix `init` downgrading the upstream `uses:` pins of a repository that adopted a release still inside the `minimum-release-age` window. The cooldown now gates adoptions only, and a rollback to an older repomatic is honored.
- `init` no longer closes with "commit the generated files and push" on a run that produced nothing but ephemeral output.
- Fix the broken-links and setup-guide jobs dying on a recurring issue that the `autolock` workflow had locked. A conversation lock blocking a close or reopen comment is now cleared and the write retried.
- Fix `repomatic run` finding no binary on a Linux distribution `extra-platforms` cannot name, which broke every registry tool inside the AlmaLinux-based manylinux build container.
- Fix a crash when `pyproject.toml` is removed while being read, which now falls back to an empty configuration as documented.
- Re-lock `uv.lock` in the release freeze commit, so a release no longer ships with its version ahead of its own lock entry. The desync made the Windows binary builds fail.

## [`7.5.0` (2026-08-07)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.4.1...v7.5.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.5.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.5.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.5.0).

- **Breaking:** bundled skills drop `model` and `disable-model-invocation`, so every skill is now model-invocable and runs on the session model. The recommended model moved to the spec's `compatibility` field.
- **Breaking:** workflows now run the CLI from `uv.lock` with `uv run --frozen` instead of `uvx --from .`, so installs are hash-verified. The release freeze still pins downstream to `uvx 'repomatic==X.Y.Z'`.
- `minimum-release-age` now defaults to `1 week` (was `8 days`) and `[tool.uv] exclude-newer` tracks it, closing the band where `uv.lock` could pin a version CI then refused to install.
- Reject a dependency floor naming a release still inside the cooldown window, which would ship a package that downstream repos and `uvx` users cannot resolve.
- Fix the `sync-*` updaters adopting a release published on the cutoff day itself, which uv then refused to resolve because it applies the window to the hour rather than the day.
- `sync-workflow-pins` now warns when a pin already in the tree sits inside the cooldown, instead of only judging the version it is about to write.
- A `lint-repo` check that cannot read its GitHub API response now reports one "could not query API" outcome instead of separate unreachable-API and unparsable-JSON messages.
- Fix `prepare-release` and `sync-github-releases` reading `./changelog.md` instead of the configured `changelog.location`.
- Fix a PR body template's `footer: false` being ignored, appending the attribution footer to a template that opted out of it.
- Fix template and skill frontmatter truncating at a value that embeds `---`, dropping every field below it.
- Trim the hand-maintained example dumps from `metadata`'s module and `nuitka_matrix` docstrings, which had drifted from the values they claimed to show.
- Fix docstrings where a brace placeholder against a closing backtick rendered as a spurious role, swallowing the prose after it.
- Every workflow now gates package installs behind the `minimum-release-age` cooldown, so no `uvx`, `uv pip install`, `npm install` or `npx` resolves a release published inside the window.
- A thin caller carrying extra downstream jobs now gets a top-level `permissions: {}`, and on its managed job the union of the scopes the reusable workflow's jobs declare. Callers with no extra jobs are untouched.
- `astral-sh/setup-uv` steps now pin the uv version, bumped by `sync-workflow-pins` once a release clears the cooldown, instead of installing the newest build satisfying `required-version`.
- `repomatic run mdformat` provisions its own `shfmt` at the registry-pinned version, so formatting shell blocks in Markdown no longer needs a system `shfmt`.
- New `path_tools` field on a tool spec, naming registry tools whose binary must be on `PATH` while it runs.
- Fix `repomatic run mdformat` aborting on Windows ARM64, where `shfmt` publishes no binary: a companion missing for the platform is now skipped with a warning.
- Fix the macOS binary builds, which crashed in code signing once skills joined the bundled data: an `--include-data-dir` source holding symlinks is now staged symlink-free. Reported upstream as [Nuitka/Nuitka#3994](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/3994).
- The `format-markdown` job drops back to the lean `ubuntu-slim` runner, and its awesome-list fixup uses `sed` instead of `gawk`.
- `apt-get` replaces `apt` in every workflow step, with `--no-install-recommends` throughout.
- Add `gh` to the `repomatic run` registry. The release engine's attestation check now uses it instead of adding GitHub's RPM repository to the build container and installing an unpinned `gh`.
- A tool's `strip_components` accepts a per-platform mapping, like `archive_format` already did.
- Add `oxipng` to the `repomatic run` registry, bumped to `10.1.1`. `format-images` now uses the pinned, checksum-verified build instead of a hand-fetched `.deb` installed with `dpkg`.
- Dependency-updater reports now close on the `Held back by cooldown` section, below `Cooldown bypasses`, so a PR opens on what the run changed instead of what it left alone.
- `sync-tool-versions` leaves `autofix.yaml` for a new upstream-only `self-maintenance.yaml`, and polls daily instead of weekly. Downstream `autofix.yaml` loses the four steps it could never run.
- `sync-tool-versions` now also bumps the packages pinned alongside a tool in its `uvx` environment, like mdformat's plugin set, reporting them like every other row.
- Fix `get_source_url` returning a bug-tracker or changelog sub-path instead of the repository root, and matching `project_urls` keys case-sensitively.
- The bundled ruff config sets `output-prefer-rule-codes`, so diagnostics report `ISC004` instead of `implicit-string-concatenation-in-collection-literal`. Requires ruff `0.16.1`.
- `repomatic init` holds the derived upstream workflow pin back to the newest release past the `minimum-release-age` cooldown; `--no-cooldown` pins the running version immediately.
- Commands honoring `--output` now log their destination uniformly, always naming what is written instead of mixing `Save updated results to` and a subject-less `Write to`.
- Align bundled skills with the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification): `babysit-ci` gains its required `name` field, and `allowed-tools` moves to the spec's space-separated form.
- Skills are now installed as whole folders, so one can ship the spec's optional `scripts/`, `references/` and `assets/` directories alongside its `SKILL.md`.
- Add `[tool.repomatic.flavor]` with `agent` and `ci` keys, declaring the ecosystems a repository targets. Values are [extra-platforms](https://github.com/kdeldycke/extra-platforms) trait IDs.
- `[tool.repomatic.labels.extra]` entries now carry `labelmaker`'s full per-label specification, adding `rename-from` in-place renames, multi-color lists, and the `create`, `update`, `enforce-case` and `on-rename-clash` knobs. An unknown field now warns instead of being dropped silently.
- New `release-assets` filename list in `[tool.repomatic]`: each named asset is built by a caller-side job, attested like the compiled binaries, and attached to the release draft before publication locks it.
- The man-page tarball is now attested like the compiled binaries, with its sigstore bundle attached as a `manpages.attestation.json` release asset.
- `skills.location` and `agents.location` now default to the layout of the configured `flavor.agent`, and still win when set explicitly.
- `repomatic run mdformat` drops the `mdformat-ruff` plugin and its separate ruff pin, and the bundled ruff config drops `extend-include`: ruff formats fenced Python blocks in Markdown on its own.
- Teach the `repomatic-ship` and `babysit-ci` skills to act on the first failing CI job instead of waiting out full matrices, pay down pre-existing and `⁉️`-probe test debt before the first push, and hold prose-only pushes while binary matrices drain.
- Chart the `/repomatic-ship` convergence loop (first-failing-job fixes, push timing, debt paydown) on the skills docs page.
- Re-base the release PR onto the current `main` HEAD after every build by also running `prepare-release` on `workflow_run`, so a reconciliation commit that misses `changelog.yaml`'s `paths:` filter no longer leaves the PR stale.
- `/repomatic-topics` pre-approves the `Agent` tool instead of the retired `Task` name.
- Add a `history` documentation page retracing the project from its 2021 reusable-workflow origins through the `gha-utils` CLI to the `repomatic` rename.
- Recenter the readme and the workflows page on the CLI-first design: workflows only trigger CLI commands, with local-run examples and links to the standalone binaries and history pages.
- Document Agent Skills spec conformance, and `argument-hint` as the single accepted deviation, on the skills documentation page.
- Correct the readme and benchmark page: both carried stale reusable-workflow counts, and listed `jpegoptim` among the tools `repomatic run` manages when it never was.

> `7.4.1` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.4.1/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.4.1).

- Add two review links to the release PR's `How-to release` checklist: the draft dev pre-release and the full changes against `main`.
- Teach the `repomatic-ship` pre-push gate to read the latest conclusive ancestor CI run when HEAD's own runs are still in-flight, catching a pre-existing platform-gated failure before the first push.
- Lower the uv `required-version` floor from `>=0.12` to `>=0.11.15`, the actual resolver minimum.
- Extend the `uvx` script-equals-package guard to the `pipx run <script>` install check, so `📦 Package install` no longer fails permanently for projects whose CLI script differs from their package name.

- **Breaking:** Rename `update-deps-graph` to `update-dep-graph` across the CLI command, autofix job, PR branch, and body template, aligning with the `dependency-graph` config key. Close any open `update-deps-graph` pull request; the next run reopens it on the new branch.
- **Breaking:** `repomatic init` component selectors are now case-sensitive, validated by the same code path as the `exclude` and `include` configuration entries.
- Lower the compiled-binary OS floors: Linux glibc `2.28`, built and self-tested in `manylinux_2_28` containers (RHEL 8, Debian 10, Ubuntu 20.04 and later), and macOS `11.0` (Apple silicon) / `10.15` (Intel) via uv's embedded python-build-standalone interpreter.
- Enforce each binary's OS floor at build time: `verify-binary` parses ELF, Mach-O and PE headers natively and no longer needs exiftool.
- Keep `tkinter` and its Tcl/Tk stack out of compiled binaries via the new `[tool.repomatic]` `nuitka.nofollow-imports` setting (default `["tkinter"]`, set to `[]` to bundle it).
- Emit man pages for repomatic's own CLI on docs builds and attach a `repomatic-manpages.tar.gz` asset to each release.
- Add `update-docs --check` to report out-of-date self-updating content and exit non-zero without writing, for CI drift detection. The docs update script must accept its own `--check` flag to participate.
- Add a `check_sha_pinning_required` lint check and setup-guide step for GitHub's `sha_pinning_required` Actions setting, the platform-enforced backstop for action SHA pinning.
- Unify the `lint-repo` checks on one tri-state result protocol: skipped checks now print `ℹ` instead of a misleading `✓`.
- Key the CI tool-binary caches on `tool_registry.py` instead of the whole runner module, so engine-only changes stop invalidating cached tools.
- Report `sync-deps` and `update-checksums` progress as a `✓`/`✘` trail with a running tally and a timed summary.
- Warn about unknown `[tool.repomatic]` keys once per project and process, instead of on every configuration re-load.
- Loosen the uv `required-version` pin to a lower bound (`>=0.12`), dropping the per-minor upper cap so uv can update across minors without a manual bump.
- Move the docs link checker from `ubuntu-slim` to `ubuntu-24.04-arm`: the crawl outgrew the slim runner's 15-minute job cap.
- Extend the bundled lychee configuration with generic excludes: GitHub issue-comment fragments, release binary downloads, and DOI-to-Zenodo redirects.
- Declare least-privilege permissions on the canonical `release.yaml`, clearing the workflow `check_workflow_permissions` lint.
- Extend the `check_workflow_permissions` lint to flag a reusable-workflow call inheriting an empty top-level `permissions: {}` without its own grants: the misconfiguration that aborts a run at startup.
- Block install-time scripts and apply the `minimum-release-age` cooldown on every npm install of `awesome-lint`, hardening both the runtime and CI-provisioning paths against supply-chain attacks.
- Surface `uv audit`'s stderr when it exits without emitting JSON, replacing the bare `produced no output` error.
- Keep `metadata` from crashing when git refuses the repository (dubious ownership, unresolvable range): it now logs git's stderr and continues.
- Accept `sur` (macOS Big Sur, Homebrew's `big_sur` bottle tag) as a valid word in the bundled typos configuration, so `fix-typos` stops correcting it to `sure`.
- Document the minimum OS requirement of each binary target, and the distributions it opens execution to, in a new [Minimum OS requirements](https://kdeldycke.github.io/repomatic/binaries.html#minimum-os-requirements) section that downstream binaries pages link to.
- Document how to verify a downloaded binary's build-provenance attestation with `gh attestation verify` on the installation page.
- Order the installation docs' Python-compatibility table newest-first, so the latest release and Python version read from the upper-left.
- Rename the binaries page chart markers to `binaries-chart`/`binaries-chart-end`, aligning on click-extra's `<!-- name --> / <!-- name-end -->` marker grammar; pages carrying older markers are migrated on their next refresh.
- Fix the click-extra `{matrix}` directive link on the installation page, and realign page octicons with the `sphinx-docs` agent's extended icon registry.
- Emit an absolute `og:image` URL for social previews: `ogp_site_url` now backs `ogp_image` in the docs configuration.
- Pin the install guide's versioned CLI examples (`pkg@X.Y.Z`, `pkg==X.Y.Z`) to the release in the prepare-release freeze step.
- Direct the `babysit-ci` skill to announce its early exit and name the still-unverified `release.yaml` binary run, instead of stopping on a silent idle.
- Harden the `repomatic-ship` skill: forbid detached `Monitor` polling, read the whole unreleased changelog section at invocation, and align every convention description its docs pass corrects.
- Extend the `sphinx-docs` agent and `sphinx-docs-sync` skill: the `{click:run}` `--version` trap, thin-schema combined CLI page, Cloudflare-blocked intersphinx probes, mdformat seed-block collapse, plus release-asset, self-healing-marker, and linkcheck audit guards.
- Note in the `repomatic-ship` skill that changelog released sections are immutable, and that a workflow cache-key line-length fix cannot lift `hashFiles()` into a workflow-level `env:`.

## [`7.3.1` (2026-07-28)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.3.0...v7.3.1)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.3.1` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.3.1/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.3.1).

- Refresh the bundled pytest defaults to the canonical configuration: `importlib` import mode, `tests/`-restricted collection, the `once` marker, parallel runs via `pytest-xdist`, and `--cov-report=xml` left to the test workflow's command line.
- Mark the `validate-arch` job of `tests.yaml` as canonical-repository-only: downstream repos drop the job and its `build_targets` metadata field when adapting the workflow.
- Point the `lint-changelog` `not found on PyPI` warning at its remedy: list intentionally-unpublished releases under `[tool.repomatic] abandoned-versions`.
- Fix the post-release re-trigger of `changelog.yaml`: its `workflow_run` filter still watched the pre-emoji `Build & release` workflow name and never fired.
- Fix `lint-changelog --fix` treating a published pre-release (`X.Y.Z.dev0`, `rc`, `alpha`, `beta`) as a missing changelog entry, which inserted a spurious section and rewrote the adjacent release's comparison URL.
- Fix the `update-docs` autofix job opening a duplicate of the `format-pyproject` pull request: it now reformats `pyproject.toml` only when `update-docs` changed it.
- Skip the bare `uvx <script>` invocation of the package-install smoke job when the CLI script is not named after its package.
- Restructure the `repomatic-ship` skill: rules shared by every spawned agent move to a single section, and accumulated incident notes compress into their operative rules.
- Harden the `repomatic-ship` release checks: dispatch `release.yaml` past a content-skipped binary matrix, revert formatter moves whole, read the freeze scope from the regenerated release PR, and verify `{click:run}` blocks against the live CLI.
- Direct the `repomatic-ship` docs pass to advance version samples lagging the released tag up to it.
- Note in the `repomatic-ship` and `babysit-ci` skills that CI log fetches write under `~/.cache/gh` and need the sandbox off.

## [`7.3.0` (2026-07-23)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.2.0...v7.3.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.3.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.3.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.3.0).

- **Breaking:** Move the MyST docstring toolchain upstream to click-extra, now floored at `8.5`: the `repomatic.myst_docstrings` Sphinx extension becomes `click_extra.sphinx.myst_docstrings` (point `conf.py` at the new module path), and the `convert-to-myst` command becomes `click-extra convert-to-myst`.
- Warn on unknown `[tool.repomatic]` keys through click-extra's schema layer, covering nested tables too; the warning now names keys in snake_case.
- Upload each release binary under a versionless alias, so the stable `releases/latest/download` URLs keep resolving across releases.
- Mark the upstream toolkit's lockstep-aligned pin with a `⛓️ lockstep` docs link in the `sync-workflow-pins` PR table, instead of an empty `Released` cell.
- Add a ⚙️ emoji to the `Configuration` section heading of PR bodies, and swap the `Held back by cooldown` section's 🔜 emoji for ⏸️.
- Disable ruff's `unsafe-fixes` in the bundled defaults, so `--fix` and the autofix workflow only apply semantics-preserving fixes.
- Expose `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the Sphinx linkcheck step of the docs workflow, so a repo's `conf.py` can authenticate its github.com checks via `linkcheck_request_headers`.
- Space out the Windows exiftool install with step-level retries, absorbing Chocolatey community-feed outages that punch through choco's own `--retry-count`.
- Fix the `exclude` and `include` configuration reference to list `agents` among the default-excluded components.
- Exclude `once`-marked tests from every test-matrix cell and run them in a dedicated single-runner `once-tests` job with its own coverage upload.
- Teach the `repomatic-ship` and `babysit-ci` skills that the Nuitka binary matrix only exists on projects enabling `[tool.repomatic] nuitka.enabled`, and how to verify binary-less releases.
- Fix the `repomatic-ship` local-gate tool recipes: pass `biome` and `shfmt` their args forms, and smoke checksum-pinned tools with no matching files via `--version` only.
- Broaden the `repomatic-ship` review scopes: version samples are audited against the last freeze commit's file list, and platform-gated tests are reviewed with the inputs they consume.
- Require the `repomatic-ship` sweep agents to message their final reports to the orchestrator, with one chase on a silent idle.
- Point the changelog over-length warning and the `repomatic-changelog` skill at the canonical entry-length guideline URL, which downstream `CLAUDE.md` copies lack.

## [`7.2.0` (2026-07-16)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.1.0...v7.2.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.2.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.2.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.2.0).

- **Breaking:** the `release-prep` command is renamed `prepare-release`, matching the job, template, and PR branch it drives.
- **Breaking:** the `version-check` command is renamed `check-version`.
- Add `cancel-runs`: cancels a branch's in-progress and queued workflow runs, replacing the bash block in `cancel-runs.yaml`; run listings now paginate past the first page.
- Add `[tool.repomatic] binaries.sync`: set to `false` to stop the release pipeline from committing the binaries catalog and scan records to the default branch.
- Add `sync-dep-sources`, a fifth `sync-deps` updater: once the release named by a git-tracked dependency's `.dev` floor ships on PyPI, it drops the `[tool.uv.sources]` override, tightens the floor, and freezes the adopted release through the cooldown. Disable with `[tool.repomatic] dep-sources.sync`.
- `Dialect`, `ArchiveFormat`, and `WorkflowFormat` now carry their dispatch as enum methods (`serialize`, `extract`, `write_workflow`).
- Rename cross-module internals to public names: `COMPONENTS_BY_NAME`, `is_source_repo`, `format_released`, `format_upload_date`, `date_to_utc_cutoff`.
- The `sponsor-labeller` job in `labels.yaml` is renamed `sponsor-label`, matching the CLI command it runs.
- Remove the dead `get_default_repo` and `list_open_issues` helpers and the unused `REQUIRED_PAT_PERMISSIONS` constant.
- `update-deps-graph` now keeps only directly-declared dependencies inside the `--group` and `--extra` boxes, renders transitive dependencies as plain ovals, and counts an extra's transitives as depth 2 under `--level`.
- The unsubscribe workflow's GraphQL phase now re-validates each item's staleness client-side and reports the items it holds back.
- The `unsubscribe.yaml` workflow now streams per-thread progress to the job log.
- Generated PR and issue bodies now use `##` section headings, with `Release notes` nested as a `###` subsection; release bodies embedded in dropdowns get their headings demoted below the per-version heading.
- Generated PR bodies drop the boilerplate `Description` section, and the `Workflow metadata` block becomes a compact list led by a `Documentation` link to the job's section of the workflows reference.
- The `Cooldown bypasses` PR section is now a single table: `🧹 cleared:`, `📌 frozen:`, and `🚧 unreleased:` rows with a `Held until` expiry column.
- Diff tables label added and removed packages with `🆕 new:` and `🗑️ removed:` prefixes ahead of the version.
- `sync-action-pins` and `sync-workflow-pins` PR bodies now report an action or package pinned at several versions as a single row spanning from the oldest pin.
- The `update-docs` job now re-formats `pyproject.toml` files with `pyproject-fmt` after running the project's update script.
- GitHub Releases API reads now resolve their token like every other GitHub access (`REPOMATIC_PAT` first), instead of hitting the anonymous rate limit.
- PyPI, npm, and GitHub API lookups now retry once on a truncated response instead of crashing with `IncompleteRead`.
- The release freeze and unfreeze steps now cover `.yml` workflow files alongside `.yaml`.
- The gitignore.io template download now times out after 10 seconds instead of hanging on a stalled connection.
- Version bumps no longer overwrite the `cff-version:` schema field in `citation.cff` when it coincides with the package version.
- `sync-action-pins` no longer rewrites `uses:` pins inside files `repomatic init` deploys verbatim, like the `publish-pypi` composite action.
- The `run typos` guidance now recommends `extend-ignore-re` guards for encoded hashes and intentional-typo examples.
- Document the scan job contract and the release-lane direct-commit exception.

## [`7.1.0` (2026-07-08)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v7.0.0...v7.1.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.1.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.1.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.1.0).

- **Breaking:** `scan-virustotal` no longer writes scan tables into GitHub release notes; the `--update-release` and `--repo` options are removed, and `--binaries-dir` is now required.
- Add `sync-binaries`: regenerates `docs/assets/binaries.csv` and its `docs/binaries.md` page, a catalog of every released binary with download links, VirusTotal analyses, and a detection trend chart.
- `sync-binaries --backfill-records` recovers detection snapshots from the VirusTotal tables of legacy release notes into the scan history file.
- The release pipeline now records each binary's `flagged / total` snapshot in `docs/assets/virustotal-scans.json` and refreshes the binaries page instead of editing release notes.
- The documentation build gains `sphinx-datatables`, rendering the binaries catalog as a searchable, sortable table; downstream repos can opt in with the same extension.
- Add `git-commit-push`: commits files and pushes them, rebasing and retrying on rejection, for release jobs publishing generated files to the default branch.
- Add a global `--jobs` option controlling how many parallel workers commands may use, defaulting to one fewer than the host's logical CPUs.
- `update-checksums`, `sync-tool-versions`, and `sync-deps` now download artifacts and resolve updates concurrently, sized by `--jobs`; Ctrl+C aborts the fan-out promptly and `--verbosity DEBUG` collapses it to sequential.
- `sync-uv-lock` PR bodies gain a `Cooldown bypasses` section: each active `exclude-newer-package` freeze with the date it expires and is cleared from `pyproject.toml`, plus the entries the run froze or pruned.
- The `Held back by cooldown` table now also lists releases blocked by an `exclude-newer-package` freeze, not only those inside the global `exclude-newer` window.
- `update-docs` gains a fourth phase refreshing self-updating `{matrix}` directive blocks in `docs/` and `readme.md`; the Python compatibility matrix in the installation docs now renders from those markers instead of an in-repo generator.
- The CLI, configuration, and tool-runner references in the docs render live through the `click:tree`, `click:config`, and `{python:render}` directives; the checked-in generated tables and `docs/docs_update.py` are removed.
- Each tool section in the tool-runner reference shows Stars and Last release badges; the separate `Comparison` table is removed.
- Require `click-extra >= 8.3`, adding the `--export-config` option, `--theme auto` terminal-background detection, and the `click:config` Sphinx directive.
- Label added and removed packages in dependency report tables consistently after the version, with 🆕 and 🗑️ status emoji.
- `sync-workflow-pins` now aligns the inline `repomatic` pin to the newest `uses:` ref version, bypassing the release-age cooldown.
- `sync-action-pins` now converges actions pinned at several versions onto the highest pin, even when no newer release clears the cooldown.
- Trim oversized PR and issue bodies to GitHub's 65536-character limit, preserving the refresh tip, metadata block, and attribution footer.
- Add the humanized age next to `Released` dates in `fix-vulnerable-deps` reports, matching the other dependency updaters.
- `update-deps-graph` now places a package declared by several groups or extras in the box where most of its dependents live, drawing the duplicates with a dashed border and a dotted identity link to the real node.
- The setup guide and `lint-repo` now flag a missing `REPOMATIC_NOTIFICATIONS_PAT` secret when `notification.unsubscribe` is enabled.
- Exclude VirusTotal analysis links from lychee broken-link checks.
- Update the `av-false-positive` skill to start from the scan history file and to record post-submission re-scans into it.
- The `babysit-ci` and `repomatic-ship` skills now mandate sleeps between CI polls and document GitHub API rate-limit exhaustion, whose symptoms masquerade as PAT permission errors.
- Fix `sync-uv-lock` reporting `No dependency changes` and writing no PR body when a run only prunes or freezes cooldown bypasses in `pyproject.toml`.
- Fix downstream manual dispatches of the `unsubscribe` workflow ignoring their inputs and always running live: generated thin callers now forward `workflow_dispatch` inputs to the reusable workflow.
- The `publish-pypi` composite action and the `unsubscribe` workflow no longer trigger setup-uv's cache-invalidation and `Empty workdir detected` warnings on downstream runs, which execute without a checkout.
- The PR-creation steps of the changelog workflow now time out after 10 minutes instead of hanging when the GitHub API is rate-limit starved.
- Fix the binary cache purging fresh entries whose release archive carries an old build date: cached binaries are now aged by their store time, not the archive's mtime.
- `repomatic run` now reports a truncated tool download as `got X of Y bytes` instead of a SHA-256 mismatch, which read as a stale checksum or a tampered artifact.
- Rebuild binaries on pushes that only touch `.github/workflows/_release-engine.yaml`: the release workflow split left the engine lane outside the binary-affecting paths.
- Disable mouse zoom on the class inheritance diagrams of the documentation's API sections, so they no longer hijack page scrolling; the fullscreen viewer keeps zoom.

## [`7.0.0` (2026-07-02)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.31.0...v7.0.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `7.0.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/7.0.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v7.0.0).

- **Breaking:** Remove the Renovate integration: the `renovate.yaml` workflow, the bundled `renovate.json5`, the `check-renovate` command, and the Dependabot-to-Renovate migration are gone, replaced by self-hosted dependency updates (below). Downstream repos prune the orphaned files on their next `repomatic init`.
- **Breaking:** `repomatic update-checksums` is now registry-only: the workflow-file argument and the `--registry` flag are removed, so it only refreshes the binary tool checksums.
- Add `sync-deps`, the single entry point for dependency updates: runs every enabled updater or a named subset in parallel and applies them in order, with a `--dry-run` preview.
- Add `sync-tool-versions`: bumps each `repomatic run` tool to its latest release past the cooldown and refreshes the binary tool checksums in the same pass.
- Add `sync-action-pins`: bumps SHA-pinned GitHub Actions to their latest release past the cooldown, resolving each release tag to its commit SHA.
- Add `sync-workflow-pins`: bumps the npm and PyPI version literals embedded in workflow YAML past the cooldown.
- Add `[tool.repomatic] minimum-release-age` (default `8 days`), the shared stabilization cooldown for the sync updaters, plus per-updater `tool-versions.sync`, `action-pins.sync`, and `workflow-pins.sync` toggles.
- `repomatic run` now runs npm-backed tools, starting with `awesome-lint`, installed from the npm registry with per-tarball integrity and the `minimum-release-age` cooldown; the `lint-awesome` job now calls `repomatic run awesome-lint`.
- Add a `[tool.repomatic] changelog.archive-location` option pointing at an archive file for older release sections, so `lint-changelog` treats archived versions as documented instead of flagging them as orphans.
- Dependency-updater PR bodies now share `sync-uv-lock`'s format: a cooldown cutoff date, a `Held back by cooldown` section, and a `Release notes` dropdown between them.
- `repomatic run` now applies the `minimum-release-age` cooldown to the transitive dependencies of its `uvx`-installed tools; binary and `uv run` tools stay pinned as before.
- The autofix workflow now runs the dependency updaters weekly on a schedule, so quiet repositories still pick up dependency, tool, and action-pin updates.
- `REPOMATIC_PAT` no longer requires the `Commit statuses` permission; `lint-repo` now warns when a token still grants it so it can be tightened.
- Drop the `pydriller` dependency: Git history operations now invoke the `git` CLI directly, shrinking the install and compiled-binary footprint.
- `repomatic run` now animates a spinner while downloading a tool whose server omits a `Content-Length`, where it previously showed nothing.
- The generated Python compatibility matrix in `install.md` now covers pre-classifier releases, falling back to `requires-python`, Poetry, or `setup.py` metadata to infer supported versions.
- Fix `update-deps-graph` rendering only one of several extras or dependency groups that share a directly-declared dependency; each now gets its own subgraph.
- Fix broken documentation links: the standalone-binary downloads (versionless 404s), the `pipx` installation guide, and the GitHub matrix-strategy reference.

## [`6.31.0` (2026-06-27)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.30.0...v6.31.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.31.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.31.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.31.0).

- `sync-uv-lock` PRs now list newer releases held back by the `exclude-newer` cooldown, with the date each ages out of the window.
- `sync-uv-lock` package tables now annotate each release date with a relative hint (`2 days ago`, `in 3 days`).
- Autofix PR bodies now document every relevant `[tool.repomatic]` option in their Configuration section.
- The test workflow uploads coverage to Codecov from one runner per OS, not from every matrix cell.
- Drop the Codecov Test Analytics (test results) upload and the `junit.xml` file it generated.
- `update-checksums --registry` now maintains binary tool checksums in a dedicated `repomatic/tool_checksums.py` module.
- Update `pyproject-fmt` to `2.25.1`, which keeps comments inside inline tables when `format-pyproject` reorders their keys.
- Fix the PyPI availability admonition missing from GitHub release notes.
- Fix `repomatic run biome` failing with a SHA-256 mismatch: Biome `2.5.0`'s binary checksums were stale, breaking JSON, JavaScript, and TypeScript format jobs.
- Fix `[tool.repomatic] workflow.sync = false` being ignored: it now skips workflow sync like the other `*.sync` toggles.

## [`6.30.0` (2026-06-24)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.29.0...v6.30.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.30.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.30.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.30.0).

- **Breaking:** The test and release workflows now run `click-extra test-suite` (the `test-plan` engine renamed in click-extra `8.1`), reading the suite from `./tests/cli-test-suite.toml`. Requires `click-extra >= 8.1`.
- `repomatic lint-repo` now fails when a workflow's inline `repomatic==X.Y.Z` pin lags the version of its `uses:` ref.
- The test workflow skips the Codecov upload on free-threaded Python (`3.14t`), where codecov-cli cannot build its `test-results-parser` extension.
- In generated dependency graphs, thick arrows now mark only the root package's direct dependencies; a transitive edge that points at a primary dependency stays thin, so optional extras no longer read as a primary dependency chain.
- The release workflow now cancels superseded runs on rapid non-release pushes to `main`, so intermediate commits no longer pile up redundant binary builds; release commits still run to completion.

## [`6.29.0` (2026-06-22)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.28.1...v6.29.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.29.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.29.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.29.0).

- **Breaking:** Remove the `repomatic test-plan` command and `[tool.repomatic] test-plan` config. The declarative test-plan engine moved upstream to [click-extra](https://kdeldycke.github.io/click-extra/test-suite.html); run `click-extra test-plan` instead, configured via `[tool.click-extra.test-plan]`.
- Add `repomatic show-test-matrix` to render the CI test matrix as a Python-version by OS grid in any `--table-format`.
- Add `repomatic init uv` to sync the canonical `[tool.uv]` pins (`required-version`, `exclude-newer`) into `pyproject.toml`; `sync-uv-lock` applies the same sync, so every machine resolves `uv.lock` with the same uv.
- Require `click-extra >= 8`; the `manpages` release job now uses `click-extra wrap --man` to generate man pages.
- The binary download progress bar now respects `--no-progress` and `--accessible`, hiding it when progress output is turned off.
- Move the Sphinx linkcheck output to `docs/_linkcheck/` (mirroring `docs/_build/`); `broken-links --output-json` now defaults there and the generated `.gitignore` excludes it.
- `repomatic run` now warns when `--check` targets a post-processed formatter (currently `mdformat`): check mode bypasses the fixup, so its exit status can mislead.
- `sync-uv-lock` now reverts a re-lock that changed no package versions, so uv's machine-dependent re-spelling of equivalent `uv.lock` environment markers no longer opens empty sync PRs that ping-pong between contributors and CI.
- Documentation pages that cover a Python module now end with that module's API reference.
- Test the free-threaded `3.14t` build as a stable single-runner smoke test instead of across the full cross-platform matrix; `3.15` stays `continue-on-error`.

## [`6.28.1` (2026-06-19)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.28.0...v6.28.1)

> [!NOTE]

- Fix `test-matrix.full-include` matrices emitting combinations that `exclude` should have removed; they now follow GitHub's documented include/exclude algorithm.

## [`6.28.0` (2026-06-19)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.27.0...v6.28.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.28.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.28.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.28.0).

- `repomatic test-plan` runs its cases in parallel by default (one fewer than the CPU count); pass `--jobs 1` for sequential execution.
- Add `[tool.repomatic] test-matrix.full-include` config: declare full-matrix-only job rows as explicit combinations (each merged onto the shipped-config defaults), a readable alternative to a long `test-matrix.exclude` list.
- Run the pull-request test matrix on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` for faster Linux CI; the full test matrix still covers x86 Linux.
- `repomatic metadata` no longer prints spurious `--overwrite` or `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` warnings when writing to stdout.
- Add a [test-matrix guide](https://kdeldycke.github.io/repomatic/test-matrix.html) to the docs: choosing matrix targets, a GitHub-runner speed inventory, and a worked example.

## [`6.27.0` (2026-06-18)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.26.0...v6.27.0)

> `6.27.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.27.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.27.0).

- **Breaking:** Replace `fix-vulnerable-deps` with `audit`. `repomatic audit` reports vulnerable dependencies read-only; `repomatic audit --fix` performs the previous upgrade behavior.
- Stop forcing `pyproject-fmt` table expansion: `project.urls`, `project.scripts`, and similar sections now use its default compact (dotted-key) form.
- Recognize each bundled tool's native config files more accurately (`biome`, `gitleaks`, `ruff`, `typos`, `zizmor`, and others) and their config-file CLI flags.
- Preserve comments when materializing a `[tool.X]` section from `pyproject.toml` to a tool's native TOML config file (like `.gitleaks.toml`), instead of dropping them.
- Update `pyproject-fmt` to `2.25.0`, fixing the `format-pyproject` job writing invalid TOML when it reformats `[tool.repomatic.labels]` rule tables.
- Align the bundled `[tool.bumpversion]` and `[tool.lychee]` templates with `pyproject-fmt`'s canonical output, ending the reformatting pull-request loops they triggered.
- Fix cooldown bypasses (`[tool.uv] exclude-newer-package`) never expiring: `sync-uv-lock` now freezes each one at its locked version instead of a latest-tracking `"0 day"` span, and prunes it once that version ages past `exclude-newer`.
- Fix `uv.lock` ping-ponging on every `sync-uv-lock` run: `exclude-newer-package` freezes are now explicit UTC timestamps, not bare dates that uv re-expands in the locking machine's timezone.
- Fix the `repomatic.myst_docstrings` Sphinx extension corrupting two adjacent inline-code spans in a docstring when the second span starts with an underscore.
- Fix the `manpages` release job: attach the man-page tarball to the release draft before publishing, so it no longer fails under GitHub immutable releases.

## [`6.26.0` (2026-06-17)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.25.1...v6.26.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.26.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.26.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.26.0).

- Add `[tool.repomatic] nuitka.extras` config to sync listed `[project.optional-dependencies]` extras into the venv before the Nuitka build, so optional features land in the binary.
- Add `[tool.repomatic.labels]` `extra`, `file-rules`, and `content-rules` config for inline label definitions and labeller rules, replacing the silently-ignored `extra-file-rules` and `extra-content-rules` fields.
- Stop version-bump PRs from upgrading dependencies: the bump and release jobs now run plain `uv lock`, leaving dependency refreshes to the `sync-uv-lock` job.
- Add a `[tool.repomatic] changelog.bullet-word-threshold` config: `lint-changelog` warns (non-fatally) about unreleased changelog bullets longer than the threshold (40 words by default).

## [`6.25.1` (2026-06-13)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.25.0...v6.25.1)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.25.1` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.25.1/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.25.1).

- Fix `uvx repomatic@X.Y.Z` failing for end users with `No solution found` by dropping the `bump-my-version` dependency and reading the current version natively from `.bumpversion.toml` or `[tool.bumpversion]`.
- Remove the `uv-overrides.txt` file and all `UV_OVERRIDE` workflow env blocks.
- Render the Mermaid dependency graph in `docs/install.md` under a new `Default dependencies` section.

## [`6.25.0` (2026-06-13)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.24.0...v6.25.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.25.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.25.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.25.0).

- Add man page generation to the release and docs pipelines via a `manpages` job, activated by `[tool.repomatic.manpages]` config keys (`script`, `asset-name`); requires `click-extra>=7.19`.
- Validate `[project.scripts]` entries when building the Nuitka matrix, rejecting path-shaped, empty, or malformed script names up front with a clear error.
- Replace the `tomlkit` and `tomli` dependencies with [`tomlrt`](https://dimbleby.github.io/tomlrt/) for all TOML reads and comment-preserving writes.
- Annotate `gh` and PAT permission check failures with the current [githubstatus.com](https://www.githubstatus.com) summary, and surface raw stderr on non-403 failures instead of misreporting missing scopes.
- Recognize friendly durations (`24 hours`, `30 minutes`) and ISO 8601 durations (`PT24H`, `P7D`) in `[tool.uv].exclude-newer` when computing the `repomatic sync-uv-lock` cooldown.
- Fix `UV_OVERRIDE` not reaching Renovate's child processes during `update-checksums`.
- Add `[tool.repomatic] abandoned-versions` to `lint-changelog`, reporting listed versions as skipped instead of warning that they are missing from PyPI.
- Tighten `/repomatic-ship`'s pre-push gate with `ruff format --check` and a `repomatic --version` dependency-resolution smoke run.

## [`6.24.0` (2026-05-28)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.23.0...v6.24.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.24.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.24.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.24.0).

- Publish to PyPI right after the wheel builds instead of waiting for the full release engine, by splitting the build into a `_release-build.yaml` lane that `release.yaml`'s `publish-pypi` job depends on.

## [`6.23.0` (2026-05-28)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.22.0...v6.23.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.23.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.23.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.23.0).

- Split `release.yaml` into a thin entry workflow and a new reusable `_release-engine.yaml` engine; the entry keeps `publish-pypi` so PyPI Trusted Publisher OIDC resolves to each repo's own `release.yaml`.
- Remove the `release-publish-pypi-job.yaml` data fragment; `release.yaml` is now the single source for the `publish-pypi` job.
- Require `uv` >= `0.11.15` for the vulnerability scan and parse `uv audit --output-format json` directly, raising a clear error on unsupported `uv` versions and deduplicating advisories across sources by alias.
- Refine `/repomatic-ship` to re-consolidate the changelog after the babysit phase and re-dispatch `changelog.yaml` after a code-only fix push so the release PR stays current.
- Extend `/babysit-ci` to also monitor `autofix.yaml`, diagnosing and fixing crashed mechanical-fix jobs instead of leaving them red on `main`.
- Fix `release.yaml`'s `compile-binaries` and `test-binaries` jobs aborting every non-release run with `Unexpected value ''` on projects with `nuitka.enabled = false`.

## [`6.22.0` (2026-05-25)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.21.0...v6.22.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.22.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.22.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.22.0).

- `repomatic init` now prunes downstream orphans of renamed or removed skills, agents, and workflows; locally modified copies are reported for manual review, never deleted. Pass `--keep-removed` to report without deleting, or `--delete-removed-modified` to also delete modified ones.
- `/repomatic-ship` now closes with a reflect step that reviews the session for friction and proposes fixes to the upstream `repomatic` source.
- Fix the downstream caller's `publish-pypi` job aborting every non-release `release.yaml` run with `Unexpected value ''` when its `strategy.matrix` is empty.
- Fix `/repomatic-ship` and `/babysit-ci` dropping the `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer on their autonomous commits; both skills now require it self-containedly.
- `/babysit-ci` now treats a workflow run that fails with no individual job failure as a real workflow-level error to investigate.
- Fix the documentation site's live CLI-help and example blocks rendering empty since `click-extra` 7.15.0 made execution directives opt-in.
- Seed each tool section in the [tool-runner docs](https://kdeldycke.github.io/repomatic/tool-runner.html#available-tools) with a runnable `repomatic run` example and a minimal `[tool.X]` snippet.

## [`6.21.0` (2026-05-25)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.20.0...v6.21.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.21.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.21.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.21.0).

- Replace the `repomatic-release` skill with `repomatic-ship`, a release orchestrator that reconciles changelog, code, and docs, then commits, pushes, and babysits CI until the release PR is ready. Review-gated by default, fully autonomous under `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- Add a `modernize` mode to the `repomatic-deps` skill that reads upgraded dependencies' changelogs and refactors code to adopt their new features, gating each change on the test suite.
- Extend the `babysit-ci` skill to also monitor and triage the Nuitka `compile-binaries` job in `release.yaml`.
- Decouple the downstream caller's `publish-pypi` job from the run's overall result: it now runs under `always()` and gates on a new `package_built` output, so a cleanly built wheel publishes even when an unrelated job fails.
- Remove the `repomatic-sync`, `repomatic-lint`, and `repomatic-test` skills, which only wrapped CLI commands CI already runs on every push.
- Fix the `bump-version` job in `changelog.yaml` leaving an orphan version-bump PR open after a competing bump merged into `main`.
- Enable myst-parser's `alert` extension so GitHub-style alerts (`> [!NOTE]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`) render as admonitions on the documentation site.
- Give each tool section in the [tool-runner docs](https://kdeldycke.github.io/repomatic/tool-runner.html) a hand-maintained extra-docs region preserved across regenerations, seeded for Nuitka, and add Nuitka to the page's `[tool.X]`-support table.

## [`6.20.0` (2026-05-24)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.19.0...v6.20.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.20.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.20.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.20.0).

- **Breaking:** remove `[tool.repomatic] nuitka.extra-args`. Configure Nuitka flags through `[tool.nuitka]` in `pyproject.toml` instead (`--include-data-files=SRC=DEST` becomes `include-data-files = ["SRC=DEST"]`).
- `repomatic run nuitka` now installs the pinned Nuitka, reads `[tool.nuitka]` from `pyproject.toml`, and passes the section as CLI flags; Nuitka appears in `repomatic run --list`.
- Build Nuitka binaries on Python 3.14.
- Switch `[tool.typos]` sync to `ONGOING`: canonical proper-noun identifiers merge into a pre-existing `[tool.typos]` section instead of skipping it, preserving local keys and entries.
- Add `[[tool.bumpversion.files]]` rules to the bundled template so downstream Python repos sync `[tool.nuitka]`'s numeric version keys without rewriting them on `[project]` bumps.
- Add `test-matrix.unstable` config: matrix-key dicts (like `{click-version = "main"}`) that mark matching full-matrix combinations `continue-on-error` in CI.
- Add a `lint-repo` check warning when a `[tool.repomatic.test-matrix] exclude` entry references a runner or Python version absent from the live matrix axes.
- Add `workflow_dispatch` triggers to `release.yaml` and `update-checksums.yaml` for manual re-runs.

## [`6.19.0` (2026-05-21)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.18.4...v6.19.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.19.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.19.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.19.0).

- Add `repomatic close-stale-bump-pr --part minor|major` to close orphan version-bump PRs left by races between the `changelog.yaml` schedule and a competing push.
- Expand sponsor benefits in the awesome template's `contributing.md`: sponsors get a dedicated entry in the matching section and a waiver on the licensing-marker requirement.
- Switch the `Sync uv.lock` steps in `changelog.yaml` from `uv sync` to `uv lock --upgrade`, folding pending transitive refreshes into the bump commit.
- Make `lint-changelog --fix` refuse to rewrite admonitions when an upstream GitHub or PyPI lookup looks unhealthy, instead of applying a corrupted view.
- Skip CI for automated version-bump operations across `tests.yaml`, `lint.yaml`, `labels.yaml`, and `release.yaml` via a unified `metadata` gate.
- Reduce CI scheduling with `paths-ignore`/`paths:` filters and per-job gates that skip lint jobs when no relevant files changed.
- Bump Biome from `2.4.14` to `2.4.15`.

## [`6.18.4` (2026-05-14)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.18.3...v6.18.4)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.18.4` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.18.4/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.18.4).

- Replace `RepoScope.NON_AWESOME` with `PYTHON_ONLY`, gating Python-flavored components on a PEP 621 `[project].name` so dotfiles repos carrying `pyproject.toml` only for `[tool.*]` config skip them by default.
- The bundled `release-publish-pypi-job.yaml` fragment now participates in the `@main` to `@vX.Y.Z` rewrite, so wheels built from a freeze commit ship with the pinned action ref.
- Bump Biome from `2.4.13` to `2.4.14` and Lychee from `0.24.1` to `0.24.2`.
- Fix `fix-vulnerable-deps` placing `exclude-newer-package` at the end of `[tool.uv]`, which triggered a spurious `format-pyproject` PR on the next run.

## [`6.18.3` (2026-05-11)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.18.2...v6.18.3)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.18.3` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.18.3/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.18.3).

- Fix `autofix.yaml`'s `setup-guide` job being skipped on `workflow_dispatch` re-runs.
- Fix `release.yaml`'s `publish-pypi` job running against downstream callers and failing PyPI trusted publishing with a `job_workflow_ref` mismatch.
- Switch the `compile-binaries` job from `--onefile` to `--mode=onefile`, the documented spelling since Nuitka 4.0.

## [`6.18.2` (2026-05-08)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.18.1...v6.18.2)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.18.2` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.18.2/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.18.2).

- Fix `release.yaml` uploading distributions to PyPI without PEP 740 attestations; the build job now signs each dist file and ships the `.publish.attestation` sidecars alongside it.

## [`6.18.1` (2026-05-08)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.18.0...v6.18.1)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.18.1` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.18.1/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.18.1).

- Fix the `publish-pypi` composite action verifying build attestations on every workspace file instead of just the downloaded distribution artifacts.

## [`6.18.0` (2026-05-07)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.17.0...v6.18.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.18.0` is available on [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.18.0).

> [!WARNING]
> `6.18.0` is **not available** on 🐍 PyPI.

- **Breaking:** drop `PYPI_TOKEN` from the `release.yaml` `workflow_call.secrets:` interface. Regenerate the thin-caller workflow with `repomatic init workflows` and register a [PyPI Trusted Publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/) for your own `release.yaml`.
- Add the [`publish-pypi`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/.github/actions/publish-pypi/action.yaml) composite action that publishes via OIDC Trusted Publishing with build-attestation verification; each downstream thin-caller now runs a generated `publish-pypi` job.
- Add a `check_pypi_trusted_publisher` probe to `lint-repo` and a `setup-guide-pypi-trusted-publisher` step that points to a pre-filled PyPI publisher settings URL and stays open until the first OIDC-attested upload.
- Add `release_commits_matrix` and `package_name` outputs to the reusable `release.yaml` so callers can drive their own matrix and gate jobs on a release commit.
- New composite actions under `.github/actions/` now participate in `@main` ↔ `@vX.Y.Z` ref freeze/unfreeze without code changes.
- Fix `sync-repomatic` proposing to delete `.github/actions/publish-pypi/action.yaml` when it matched the bundled default; the file must stay on disk for GitHub Actions to resolve the `uses:` path.

## [`6.17.0` (2026-05-04)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.16.0...v6.17.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.17.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.17.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.17.0).

- Add `--template-file <path>` and `--template-arg KEY=VALUE` flags to `repomatic pr-body` so downstream repos can render project-specific PR templates without forking. `--template` and `--template-file` are mutually exclusive.
- Fix backslash-escaped brackets rendering literally in `docs/configuration.md` `**Type:**` lines (like `list\[dict[str, str]\]`).
- Fix doubled heading anchors on `docs/configuration.html` and `docs/workflows.html` (like `#dev-release-sync-dev-release-sync`).
- Collapse the most recent Python compatibility matrix row in `docs/install.md` to a major-version wildcard (like `6.x`) so the table stays stable across minor releases.

## [`6.16.0` (2026-04-29)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.15.0...v6.16.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.16.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.16.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.16.0).

- Add the `sphinx-docs` agent to the `agents` component, deployed by `repomatic init agents` or via `[tool.repomatic] include = ["agents"]`.
- Add three `[tool.repomatic.workflow]` knobs for customizing `paths:` filters in generated thin callers: `extra-paths` appends repo-specific entries, `ignore-paths` strips canonical entries absent downstream, and `paths` replaces a filter wholesale per workflow.
- Add a Python compatibility matrix to `docs/install.md`, auto-generated from the `Programming Language :: Python` classifiers declared at every release tag.
- Render each command's `--help` live in `docs/cli.md` via `{click:run}` directives instead of captured plain-text help blocks.
- Replace the `Type` column in the `docs/configuration.md` summary table with a one-line description derived from each option's docstring, and lead each per-option section with that one-liner.
- Detect vulnerable dependencies from the GitHub Advisory Database alongside the PyPA database: `fix-vulnerable-deps` now unions `uv audit` with Dependabot alerts and credits each entry's source. Configurable via `[tool.repomatic] vulnerable-deps.sources`.
- Fix generated thin-caller fidelity: triggers mirror the canonical workflow verbatim instead of always injecting `workflow_dispatch`, universal path entries are preserved, and `repomatic workflow lint` now flags extra triggers absent upstream.
- Fix `sync-uv-lock` and `fix-vulnerable-deps` PR bodies showing `1-01-01` as the `exclude-newer` cutoff when `pyproject.toml` configures a relative span like `"1 week"`.
- Fix broken documentation links in all 18 PR body templates, now pointing at the published `configuration.html` and `workflows.html` anchors with each option name linked to its own anchor.
- Fix `release.yaml` discarding healthy binaries when one matrix cell crashed: the `compile-binaries` matrix sets `fail-fast: false` and `publish-release` uploads whatever built.
- Fix `update-docs` ↔ `format-markdown` ping-pong on `docs/cli.md` and `docs/configuration.md`.
- Bump pinned `uv` to `0.11.8` and `mdformat-pelican` to `1.0.0`, fixing non-ASCII anchor links being percent-encoded on every `format-markdown` run.

## [`6.15.0` (2026-04-27)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.14.0...v6.15.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.15.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.15.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.15.0).

- Decode percent-encoded non-ASCII characters in Markdown link destinations back to their original form, so non-ASCII anchors no longer get rewritten to `%XX` on every `format-markdown` run.
- Add 💸/🆓 licensing markers to the awesome-list contributing guide, issue template, and PR template (English and Chinese mirrors): 💸 for a paid version atop an OSS core, 🆓 for fully open-source.
- Add the `agents` component to `repomatic init` for deploying Claude Code agents (`grunt-qa`, `qa-engineer`) downstream. Excluded by default; opt in via `[tool.repomatic] include = ["agents"]`. Destination set by `[tool.repomatic] agents.location`.
- Add `docs/benchmark.md` comparing repomatic against ten alternatives across template sync, repo governance, release automation, and changelog lifecycle.
- Switch MyST admonitions to backtick fences (```` ```{note} ````) instead of colon fences project-wide so `mdformat` preserves them; the `convert-to-myst` command now emits backtick fences.
- Expand the `myst_docstrings` Sphinx extension: convert plain triple-backtick code fences and footnotes to reST, and run MyST-to-reST conversion before `sphinx_autodoc_typehints`.
- Upgrade lychee to `0.24.1`, which reads its `[tool.lychee]` config directly from `pyproject.toml` so repomatic drops the TOML translation bridge.
- Fix `repomatic init` reporting unchanged files as updated; re-running against an unchanged tree is now a true no-op.
- Fix `update-docs` ↔ `format-markdown` ping-pong on `docs/tool-runner.md`.

## [`6.14.0` (2026-04-20)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.13.0...v6.14.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.14.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.14.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.14.0).

- Add a Sphinx documentation site (Furo theme, MyST-Parser) splitting the monolithic `readme.md` into focused pages: installation, configuration, CLI parameters, reusable workflows, security, skills, and a tool runner tutorial. Deployed via `docs.yaml`.
- Add the `repomatic.myst_docstrings` Sphinx extension and `repomatic.myst_converter` utility, converting MyST markdown in docstrings to reST at build time so `sphinx.ext.autodoc` works unmodified. `convert-to-myst` rewrites source files in place.
- Add a `--sort-by` option to the `show-config`, `metadata --list-keys`, `run --list`, and `cache show` commands; each defaults to a natural sort column and accepts any column name.
- Add an incremental mode to the `brand-assets` skill: when base SVGs already exist, skip the design menu and fill gaps directly.
- Add a `check_stale_gh_pages_branch` lint check and setup-guide instructions for deleting leftover `gh-pages` branches after switching to GitHub Actions deployment.
- Fix `Matrix.prune()` keeping exclude directives that reference keys absent from the matrix axes, which GitHub Actions rejects.
- Fix the setup-guide Pages step for Sphinx projects: reopen the issue when Pages is unconfigured, and offer both first-time-enable and update commands.
- Fix the `sponsor-label` job in `labels.yaml` missing an `actions/checkout` step, which caused it to fail.

## [`6.13.0` (2026-04-15)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.12.0...v6.13.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.13.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.13.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.13.0).

- Add `nuitka.entry-points` config option to select which `[project.scripts]` entries produce Nuitka binaries; aliases pointing to the same callable are deduplicated by default.
- Add two-phase VirusTotal scanning: an initial table with scan links, then a `--poll` pass that fills in a Detections column of `flagged / total` engine counts.
- Add `av-false-positive` skill to scan release binaries on VirusTotal and generate per-vendor false-positive submission files for flagged artifacts.
- Add `update-checksums.yaml` workflow that recomputes SHA-256 checksums for binary tools bumped by Renovate and commits the fix to the PR branch.
- Include release notes for every intermediate version in `sync-uv-lock` PR bodies, not just the target version.
- Config `include` entries now bypass `RepoScope` filtering, matching explicit CLI component naming; qualified entries like `skills/awesome-triage` implicitly select their parent component.
- Add baseline criteria for GitHub repositories in awesome list contributing guidelines: minimum 50 stars, not archived, and updated within 3 years.
- Add `--min-savings-bytes` option to `format-images` (default 1024) to skip images whose absolute byte savings are negligible.
- Add cross-platform binary support (macOS arm64/x64, Linux arm64/x64, Windows x64) for actionlint, biome, gitleaks, labelmaker, lychee, shfmt, and typos, plus ZIP archive extraction.
- Show a progress bar during binary tool downloads when the server reports `Content-Length`; interactive terminals only, silent in CI.
- Verify cached binaries with a two-layer integrity model: the registry checksum at download time and a `.sha256` sidecar on every cache hit.
- Enable `[tool.actionlint]` config support, translating it to `.github/actionlint.yaml` at invocation time.
- Cache downloaded tool binaries across CI runs with `actions/cache`, keyed per tool, OS, and architecture.
- Replace `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` with GitHub's native `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and `actions/deploy-pages` for documentation deployment, plus a `lint-repo` check that the Pages source is set to GitHub Actions.
- Add `benchmark-update` skill to create and maintain competitive benchmark pages (`docs/benchmark.md`) with `audit`, `init`, `add`, and `refresh-badges` modes.
- Add `upstream-audit` skill to create and maintain upstream contribution tracking pages (`docs/upstream.md`) with `audit`, `init`, `refresh`, and `sync-git` modes.
- Upgrade the macOS Intel runner from `macos-15-intel` to `macos-26-intel` across binary builds, the test matrix, and Nuitka compilation.
- Run the `lint-repo` workflow job on all repositories, not just Python projects, so generic checks apply to awesome lists too.
- Centralize GitHub token resolution with priority `REPOMATIC_PAT` > `GH_TOKEN` > `GITHUB_TOKEN` and automatic fallback to `GITHUB_TOKEN` on an expired PAT; `--has-pat` on `setup-guide` and `lint-repo` now auto-detects from `REPOMATIC_PAT`.
- Fix `exclude-newer-package` pruning in `pyproject.toml` to remove orphaned comments and emit `pyproject-fmt`-compatible inline tables.
- Give a clear error when exiftool is not installed instead of a bare `FileNotFoundError`, and verify it is on PATH after the Windows install step.
- Create parent directories for `--output` file paths in `repomatic run`, fixing lychee write errors when the output directory is missing.
- Sanitize `@mentions`, `#issue` references, and `github.com` URLs in Lychee and Sphinx linkcheck output before embedding them in the broken-links issue.

## [`6.12.0` (2026-04-13)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.11.3...v6.12.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.12.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.12.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.12.0).

- **Breaking:** rename the `shell_files` metadata key to `shfmt_files`, and exclude Zsh files and `.sh` files with a Zsh shebang from `shfmt` processing.
- Add `repomatic cache` subcommands (`show`, `clean`, `path`) and a global binary cache for downloaded tools; cached binaries are re-verified against their checksum and auto-purged after 30 days (configurable via `REPOMATIC_CACHE_MAX_AGE`). Add `--no-cache` to `repomatic run` to bypass it.
- Add an HTTP response cache for PyPI metadata and GitHub release bodies to avoid redundant API calls, plus `--namespace` on `repomatic cache clean` for targeted cleanup.
- Route generated tool configs through the cache directory and pass them explicitly via `--config`, instead of writing to `/tmp` or the repository root.
- Add `--version`, `--checksum`, and `--skip-checksum` options to `repomatic run` to override the pinned tool version and SHA-256 verification at invocation time.
- Add structured logging to `repomatic run`: `--verbosity INFO` reports config precedence, the full command, and exit code; `DEBUG` adds parsed config details.
- Add `skills.location` config option to override the Claude Code skills directory (default `./.claude/skills/`).
- Add `changelog.location` config option to override the changelog file path (default `./changelog.md`), honored by all CLI commands.
- Add `.claude/package-skills.sh` to package each Claude Code skill as a ZIP for manual upload to Claude Desktop.
- Sanitize `@mentions`, `#issue` references, and `github.com` URLs in upstream release notes embedded in `sync-uv-lock` PR bodies to prevent auto-linking and backlink cross-references.
- Use the `REPOMATIC_PAT` token in all `peter-evans/create-pull-request` steps so created PRs trigger other workflows.
- Make the `uv sync` step in `lint-types` conditional on `is_python_project`, so repos with Python files but no lockfile can still be type-checked.
- Fix `format-json` failing with a `--config-path` error when a `[tool.biome]` section exists.
- Improve the `file-bug-report` skill to check organization-level community health files before per-repo files.

## [`6.11.3` (2026-04-09)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.11.2...v6.11.3)

- Add a `lint-repo` check warning when the GitHub Actions fork PR approval policy is weaker than `first_time_contributors`, with a setup guide step to fix it.
- Add a `readme.md` supply chain security section mapping Astral's security practices to concrete repomatic implementations.
- Fix `rst_to_myst` conversion leaving RST backslash escapes in headings and not wrapping dotted module names in backticks.
- Fix the `format-pyproject` autofix job failing with exit code 123.
- Disable the uv cache in the `publish-pypi` release job, which has no checkout and emitted spurious cache-miss warnings.

## [`6.11.2` (2026-04-08)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.11.1...v6.11.2)

- Add the `shfmt` shell formatter to the tool runner (`repomatic run shfmt`).
- Add a `format-shell` autofix job to auto-format shell scripts with `shfmt`.
- Replace the `crazy-max/ghaction-virustotal` action with a native `repomatic scan-virustotal` command, fixing the silently skipped release-body update.
- Deduplicate release attestations: Python packages are now attested once in `build-package` instead of three times, and `.gitignore` is no longer accidentally attested.

## [`6.11.1` (2026-04-08)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.11.0...v6.11.1)

- Parallelize the release workflow: `compile-binaries` starts right after `metadata`, and `publish-pypi` runs concurrently with `create-tag` and `create-release`, with binary and attestation uploads deferred to `publish-release`.
- Fall back to the PyPI `project_urls` changelog link when a package has no GitHub Release, so release notes render a `[Changelog]` link instead of omitting the package.
- Fix the release workflow uploading the attestation bundle before the GitHub release draft existed.
- Skip `exclude-newer-package` exemptions for packages whose fixed version already falls within the `exclude-newer` cooldown window.
- Fix `--delete-excluded` not detecting scope-excluded component files that still exist on disk.
- Fix awesome-template sync overwriting `pyproject.toml` instead of merging, which stripped user-managed `[tool.*]` sections.
- Fix `repomatic init <component>` silently ignoring an explicitly requested component when its scope did not match the repo.
- Fix `--delete-excluded` removing opt-in workflow files in the source repo by skipping config-key exclusions there.
- Fix the `format-pyproject` autofix step running with no input files and masking tool errors.

## [`6.11.0` (2026-04-07)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.10.0...v6.11.0)

> [!WARNING]
> `6.11.0` is **not available** on 🐙 GitHub.

- Preserve extra downstream jobs when syncing thin-caller workflows; the managed job is regenerated in place while project-specific jobs, comments, and blank lines are kept.
- Add a VirusTotal scanning job to the release workflow that uploads compiled binaries to seed AV databases. Requires the optional `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` repository secret.
- Verify each attestation in CI right after `actions/attest` with `gh attestation verify`.
- Upload Sigstore attestation bundles (`.jsonl`) as GitHub release assets for compiled binaries and Python packages, enabling offline verification.
- Add a `lint-repo` warning when `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` is missing and Nuitka binary compilation is active.
- Add a VirusTotal API key setup step to the setup guide issue, shown only when Nuitka compilation is active.
- Remove the one-time bumpversion dev-versioning migration code now that all downstream repos use PEP 440 dev versioning.

## [`6.10.0` (2026-04-03)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.9.0...v6.10.0)

- **Breaking:** Remove the `-o` short option from `pr-body` and `format-images`; use `--output`.
- Add `brand-assets` skill to create and export project logo/banner SVG assets to light/dark PNG variants.
- Add `babysit-ci` skill to monitor CI test workflows, diagnose failures, fix code, and loop until stable jobs pass.
- Add `file-bug-report` skill to write upstream bug reports from contribution guidelines, issue templates, and community norms.
- Add `test-matrix.replace` and `test-matrix.remove` config to swap or drop axis values in the test matrices.
- Add `sync_mode=ONGOING` for tool configs to repeatedly sync while preserving local additions, starting with `sync-bumpversion` keeping local `[[tool.bumpversion.files]]` entries.
- Add `--output-format [markdown|github-actions]` to `sync-uv-lock`, `fix-vulnerable-deps`, `pr-body`, and `format-images`, replacing implicit `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` detection.
- Add `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock` to the default `.gitignore` extra content.
- Add a collapsible workflow metadata table (trigger, actor, commit, job, workflow, run link) to issue lifecycle comments.
- Make the `setup-guide` issue body a set of collapsible per-step sections with status indicators, and close it only once PAT, permissions, vulnerability alerts, and branch protection are all verified.
- Add `--release-notes/--no-release-notes` and `--table/--no-table` flags to `sync-uv-lock`, defaulting to a terminal table and reserving markdown for `--output`.
- Prune stale `exclude-newer-package` entries from `pyproject.toml` before relocking in `sync-uv-lock`.
- Make the `renovate` component opt-in, and exclude `renovate` and `codecov` from awesome-list repositories.
- Remove Python `3.15t` (free-threaded) from the default test matrix.
- Warn instead of crashing on unknown `[tool.repomatic]` configuration keys.
- Echo `metadata` output to stderr when `--output` targets a file, so computed matrices stay visible in CI logs.
- Add the `repomatic update-docs` command to run `sphinx-apidoc`, RST-to-MyST conversion, and `docs/docs_update.py` in one step.
- Add `docs.apidoc-extra-args`, `docs.apidoc-exclude`, and `docs.update-script` configuration options.
- Move the `sync-uv-lock` job from `renovate.yaml` to `autofix.yaml` so it runs on every push to `main`.
- Fix a CLI crash when `test-matrix.variations` or `test-matrix.replace` contain nested keys.

## [`6.9.0` (2026-03-31)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.8.0...v6.9.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.9.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.9.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.9.0).

- **Breaking:** Rename the `config` subcommand to `show-config` (it now resolves typed `[tool.repomatic]` config via click-extra).
- **Breaking:** Remove the `prebake-version` and `prebake-tag-sha` commands; use `click-extra prebake` instead.
- Add per-project test matrix configuration via `[tool.repomatic.test-matrix]`, supporting `exclude`, `include`, and `variations`.
- Replace the `audit-deps` lint job with a `fix-vulnerable-deps` autofix job that opens PRs upgrading vulnerable packages.
- Add a `codecov` bundled component that syncs `.github/codecov.yaml` to suppress noisy PR comments.
- Support tool-runner config for tools that discover config from the working directory rather than a `--config` flag.
- Move the mdformat `number` default to a bundled `mdformat.toml` so downstream repos can override it.
- Expand PAT validation in `lint-repo` and `check-renovate` with repository scope, tag ruleset, and permission checks.
- Auto-exclude `changelog.md` for awesome-list repositories.
- Migrate from `actions/attest-build-provenance` to `actions/attest`.
- Run granular PAT permission checks in `setup-guide`, keeping the issue open with a diagnostic table when permissions are incomplete.
- Fix the `setup-guide` job so PAT detection works everywhere.
- Fix an infinite cycle between the `migrate-to-renovate` and `sync-repomatic` jobs.
- Include git stderr in `git-tag` CLI error messages.

## [`6.8.0` (2026-03-27)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.7.0...v6.8.0)

> `6.8.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.8.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.8.0).

- **Breaking:** Rename `repomatic init --delete-redundant` to `--delete-unmodified`, which now also removes config files identical to bundled defaults.
- **Breaking:** Remove the deprecated `WORKFLOW_UPDATE_GITHUB_PAT` secret and its fallbacks; downstream repos must use `REPOMATIC_PAT`.
- **Breaking:** Stop persisting `[tool.ruff]` defaults into downstream `pyproject.toml`; bundled ruff config is now injected at runtime when none exists.
- **Breaking:** Remove the `sync-renovate` command, autofix job, `renovate.sync` config toggle, and PR body template; `sync-repomatic` and runtime materialization replace them.
- **Breaking:** Merge `/repomatic-deps-review` into `/repomatic-deps`, which now supports `graph` and `review` modes.
- Move the test matrix definition into `repomatic metadata` so it is available in job-level `if:` conditions.
- Reduce CI jobs on pull requests by skipping release builds, experimental Python versions, and redundant verification tests; the full matrix still runs on push to `main`.
- Make `exclude` config additive to the default exclusions (`labels`, `skills`), and add an `include` config to force-include default-excluded components.
- Auto-exclude the `awesome-triage` skill for non-awesome repositories.
- Add `--delete-excluded` to `repomatic init` to remove excluded files that still exist on disk.
- Replace the `sync-workflows` and `clean-unmodified-configs` autofix jobs with a single `sync-repomatic` job that syncs and prunes managed files in one PR.
- Add PAT capability and repo configuration checks to `lint-repo` (Renovate config, Dependabot security updates off, vulnerability alerts on, PAT permissions).
- Add stale draft release detection to `lint-repo`, warning about draft releases whose tag does not end with `.dev0`.
- Relax the abandoned-dependency threshold from 1 year to 2 years in the Renovate config.
- Fix thin-caller generation rendering `workflow_dispatch` inputs as Python dicts instead of YAML.
- Add the `/sphinx-docs-sync` skill for cross-project Sphinx documentation comparison and synchronization.
- Add the `/translation-sync` skill to detect and draft fixes for stale `readme.*.md` and `contributing.*.md` translations; auto-excluded for non-awesome repos.
- Streamline Dependabot guidance in the setup-guide issue.
- Allow `repomatic init` to accept qualified `component/file` selectors (like `repomatic init skills/repomatic-topics`).
- Only auto-include the `awesome-template` component for `awesome-*` repos when no explicit components are given.
- Add a package version diff table to `sync-uv-lock` PRs, listing updated, added, and removed packages with PyPI links and collapsible release notes.
- Document file naming conventions in `claude.md`: prefer `.yaml` over `.yml` and lowercase filenames, with a table of GitHub exceptions.
- Fix awesome-template URL rewriting to also process `.yml` files in `.github/`.
- Auto-exclude the `changelog.yaml`, `debug.yaml`, and `release.yaml` workflows for `awesome-*` repositories.
- Materialize the bundled `renovate.json5` at runtime when absent, so downstream repos can safely delete their own copy.
- Pin GitHub Actions to SHA digests via Renovate's `helpers:pinGitHubActionDigestsToSemver` preset.
- Add top-level `permissions: {}` to all workflow files, requiring each job to declare its own minimal permissions.
- Fix `sync-repomatic` deleting the upstream repo's own skills.
- Generalize the `opt_in_key` config option into `config_key`/`config_default`.

## [`6.7.0` (2026-03-24)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.6.0...v6.7.0)

> `6.7.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.7.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.7.0).

- **Breaking:** Remove the `sync-skills`, `workflow create`, and `workflow sync` commands; `repomatic init` handles all three.
- Bundle awesome-template boilerplate files in `repomatic` instead of cloning `kdeldycke/awesome-template` at runtime.
- Format every `pyproject.toml` in the repo in the `format-pyproject` job, not just the root file.
- Add a branch protection checklist to the setup-guide issue, linking to a pre-filled ruleset creation form.
- Add an opt-in `unsubscribe.yaml` reusable workflow for scheduled cleanup of closed notification threads, enabled via `notification.unsubscribe = true` and requiring `REPOMATIC_NOTIFICATIONS_PAT`.
- Surface actual `gh` CLI error messages in `unsubscribe-threads` warnings.
- Enable `delete-branch: true` on all `peter-evans/create-pull-request` invocations so stale automation PRs auto-close.
- Add `gitleaks` to the tool runner with binary download and `[tool.gitleaks]` config bridge, and migrate `lint-secrets` to `repomatic run gitleaks`.
- Move lychee config from `lychee.toml` to `[tool.lychee]` in `pyproject.toml`.
- Fix the `format-images` job by installing `oxipng` from its GitHub release `.deb` so it runs on `ubuntu-slim`.

## [`6.6.0` (2026-03-23)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.5.0...v6.6.0)

- **Breaking:** downstream repos with `yamllint` or `zizmor` in their `[tool.repomatic] exclude` list must remove those entries.
- Remove `yamllint` and `zizmor` init components; the tool runner falls back to bundled default configs at runtime. Default `exclude` is now `["labels", "skills"]`.
- Add `repomatic clean-redundant-configs` command and autofix job that removes native config files identical to bundled defaults; `repomatic init` warns about redundant configs on disk.
- Rename the `WORKFLOW_UPDATE_GITHUB_PAT` secret to `REPOMATIC_PAT`; workflows accept both names. Old-name repos get a migration issue that auto-closes once `REPOMATIC_PAT` is detected.
- Add a `setup-guide` toggle to `[tool.repomatic]` to suppress the setup guide issue.
- Pre-fill the fine-grained PAT creation form via URL and provide `gh` CLI commands for adding the secret, configuring Dependabot, and triggering a verify run.
- Add a `lint-repo` check that warns when the owner has GitHub Sponsors enabled but `.github/FUNDING.yml` is missing.

## [`6.5.0` (2026-03-23)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.4.1...v6.5.0)

- **Breaking:** the old `init.exclude` and `workflow.sync-exclude` keys are no longer recognized and raise a hard error.
- **Breaking:** remove legacy `[tool.gha-utils]` and `[tool.repokit]` config migration; rename old sections to `[tool.repomatic]` manually.
- Replace `init.exclude` and `workflow.sync-exclude` with a unified `exclude` key: bare names exclude whole components, `component/identifier` entries exclude specific files.
- Add `repomatic run <tool>` for unified tool invocation with managed config resolution (native file, `[tool.X]`, bundled default, bare); use `--list` to see managed tools and their active config source.
- Register actionlint, autopep8, biome, bump-my-version, labelmaker, lychee, mdformat, mypy, pyproject-fmt, ruff, typos, yamllint, and zizmor with `repomatic run`, and migrate all workflow tool invocations to it.
- Add a `yamllint` init component, excluded from init by default like `zizmor`.
- Add `repomatic update-checksums --registry` to refresh SHA-256 hashes for binary tools.
- Add `[tool.lychee]` and `[tool.biome]` config translation, so downstream repos can configure lychee and biome from `pyproject.toml` without separate config files.

## [`6.4.1` (2026-03-11)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.4.0...v6.4.1)

> `6.4.1` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.4.1/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.4.1).

- Add a `github-json` output dialect to `repomatic metadata` that bundles all keys into a single `metadata` output, accessed via `fromJSON(needs.metadata.outputs.metadata).key_name`.
- Add key filtering to `repomatic metadata`: pass key names as arguments to output only those values.
- Add a `--list-keys` flag to `repomatic metadata` to list all available keys with descriptions.
- Rename the `project-metadata` job and step IDs to `metadata` across all workflows.
- Rename the `linters` init component to `zizmor`; default `init.exclude` is now `["labels", "skills", "zizmor"]`.
- Remove the `sync-zizmor` job, CLI command, and `zizmor.sync` toggle; `zizmor.yaml` is now user-owned and created by `repomatic init zizmor` if missing.
- Rename the `bump-versions` job to `bump-version` in `changelog.yaml`.
- Upgrade zizmor to `1.23.0` and re-enable the `template-injection` audit.
- Fix `repomatic metadata` list values breaking GitHub Actions `${{ }}` interpolation: lists are now pre-formatted (file lists as quoted strings, plain lists space-separated, dict lists as JSON).
- Fix `repomatic workflow sync --format header-only` erroring when a target workflow file is absent downstream; missing default files are skipped and named missing files warn instead.
- Enable parallel test execution by default via `--numprocesses=auto`.

## [`6.4.0` (2026-03-10)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.3.2...v6.4.0)

> `6.4.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.4.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.4.0).

- Rename `optimize-images` to `format-images`, aligning it with the `format-*` naming convention, and add a matching PR body template.
- Allow `--prefix` and `--template` to be combined in `repomatic pr-body`; the prefix is prepended before the rendered template.
- Add `awesome-template-sync`, `bumpversion-sync`, `dev-release-sync`, `gitignore-sync`, `labels-sync`, `mailmap-sync`, `uv-lock-sync`, and `zizmor-sync` toggles to `[tool.repomatic]`, so each sync operation can be individually disabled.
- Rename `sync-linter-configs` to `sync-zizmor` (and `linter-sync` to `zizmor-sync`), naming the sync job after the tool it syncs.
- Add a `repomatic sync-labels` command wrapping `labelmaker` with toggle check, profile detection, and extra label file handling.
- Replace `AndreasAugustin/actions-template-sync` with a native `repomatic sync-awesome-template` command.
- Add `repomatic init typos` to sync the shared typos spell-checker config into `pyproject.toml`, with proper-noun corrections and `<!-- typos:off -->` / `<!-- typos:on -->` block markers.
- Skip Ruff config injection in `format-python` for non-Python projects, and skip `sync-bumpversion` for non-Python projects.
- Use TOML sub-keys for grouped `[tool.repomatic]` options (like `nuitka.enabled`, `gitignore.location`, `test-plan.file`); only `pypi-package-history` stays flat.
- Add a `workflow-source-paths` option to `[tool.repomatic]`: thin-caller and header-only workflows gain `paths:` filters for the project's source directory, auto-derived from `[project.name]`.
- Add a `repomatic config` command that renders the `[tool.repomatic]` reference table.
- Add `### Configuration` sections to PR body templates listing the relevant `[tool.repomatic]` options.

- Add `--all-extras` to the `uv sync` step in `tests.yaml` to catch incompatibilities between optional dependency groups.
- Add a `test-package-install` job to `tests.yaml` that verifies every `[project.scripts]` entry point installs and runs via `uvx`, `uv run --with`, module invocation, `uv tool install`, and `pipx run`, from PyPI and GitHub. Add a `cli_scripts` metadata output.
- Sync `customManagers` to downstream `renovate.json5` so Renovate can update inline version pins in workflow files.
- Fix thin-caller generation stripping `paths` and `paths-ignore` filters, which incorrectly restricted CI triggers downstream.
- Fix the `optimize-images` job failing on `ubuntu-slim` where `oxipng` is unavailable.
- Add a `citation.cff` `date-released` update to the bundled `bumpversion.toml` template so downstream repos keep their release date in sync on version bumps.

- `repomatic init` now always overwrites managed files (workflows, configs, skills) by default; remove the `--overwrite` flag. `changelog.md` is never overwritten once it exists.
- `repomatic init` output now distinguishes created, updated, and skipped files, and warns about excluded files still on disk.
- Auto-remove legacy `.claude/skills/gha-*/` skill directories during `repomatic init`, completing the `gha-utils` to `repomatic` rename.
- `sync-bumpversion`, `sync-linter-configs`, and `sync-skills` now report both created and updated files.
- `sync-bumpversion` now replaces the whole `[tool.bumpversion]` section from the bundled template instead of applying incremental migrations.
- Use the short SHA in release workflow job names instead of the full commit hash.

## [`6.2.1` (2026-03-06)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.2.0...v6.2.1)

- Add the `repomatic optimize-images` CLI command (lossless `oxipng` for PNG, `jpegoptim` for JPEG), replacing `calibreapp/image-actions`.
- Add the `sync-dev-release` CLI command and workflow job to maintain a rolling dev pre-release on GitHub with the latest binaries and Python package.
- Add the `repomatic-topics` skill for optimizing GitHub repository topics for discoverability.
- Add a `lint-repo` check that warns when GitHub topics are not a subset of `pyproject.toml` keywords.
- Add the `init-exclude` config option to skip components during `repomatic init`, defaulting to `["labels", "linters", "skills"]`; `workflow-sync-exclude` now also applies to `repomatic init`.
- Add `rename-from` rules to migrate all 9 default GitHub labels.
- Add the package version to compiled binary filenames (`repomatic-6.2.0-linux-arm64.bin`).
- Automatically migrate `[tool.gha-utils]` and `[tool.repokit]` config sections to `[tool.repomatic]` during `repomatic init`; commands fall back to legacy section names when `[tool.repomatic]` is absent.
- Support GitHub immutable releases by drafting releases then publishing them.
- Replace `softprops/action-gh-release` with `gh release create`; all release operations now use the `gh` CLI.
- Freeze readme binary download URLs to versioned `/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/` paths during releases.
- GitHub releases now include PyPI and GitHub availability links at creation time.
- Fix Nuitka-compiled binaries silently producing no output when the entry point is a `__main__.py` inside a package.
- Fix `update-checksums` leaving stale SHA-256 hashes when the hash and `sha256sum --check` keyword span multiple lines.
- Fix Windows ARM64 test runners using x86_64 emulation by forcing native ARM64 Python via `UV_PYTHON`.
- Fix `fix-changelog` producing a trailing blank line when the last changelog section is modified.

## [`6.1.0` (2026-02-27)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/compare/v6.0.1...v6.1.0)

> [!NOTE]
> `6.1.0` is available on [🐍 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/repomatic/6.1.0/) and [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/releases/tag/v6.1.0).

- Add the `unsubscribe-threads` CLI command to unsubscribe from closed, inactive GitHub notification threads.
- Add the `prebake-version` CLI command to inject the Git commit hash into `__version__` before Nuitka compilation, so binaries report the exact commit they were built from (e.g., `6.1.0.dev0+abc1234`).
- Add the `list-skills` CLI command to display all available Claude Code skills grouped by lifecycle phase.
- Add the `sync-github-releases` CLI command to sync GitHub release notes from `changelog.md`.
- Add the `pypi-package-history` config option so `lint-changelog` fetches releases from former package names and generates correct PyPI URLs for renamed projects.
- `lint-changelog` now detects orphaned versions (git tags, GitHub releases, or PyPI packages with no changelog entry) and inserts placeholder sections in `--fix` mode.
- Rename the `lint-changelog` workflow job to `fix-changelog`; the CLI command remains `lint-changelog`.
- Make changelog entries and GitHub release bodies template-driven via `release-notes.md` and `github-releases.md`, so editing one template affects only its destination.
- Group CLI commands into sections (Project setup, Release & versioning, Sync, Linting & checks, GitHub issues & PRs) in help output.
- Add next-step handoff suggestions to all Claude Code skills, and document skills with a grouped table and walkthrough in `readme.md`.
- Generate thin caller workflows with explicit secret forwarding instead of `secrets: inherit`.
- Move zizmor config from `.github/zizmor.yml` to `zizmor.yaml` at repo root.
