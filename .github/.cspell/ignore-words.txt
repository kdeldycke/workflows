## @generated per https://generated.at
## Auto-generated cSpell dictionary of words to assume are correctly spelled
## See https://cspell.org/docs/dictionaries-custom/
##
## If a word listed below is actually a misspelling, then either:
## 1. correct the word in the file(s) it was found in, and regen this file, or
## 2. add it as a flagWord in .cspell/overrides.yml, which will cause it to
##    always be listed as misspelled, until someone accomplishes step 1. above.
##    Once that occurs, you can remove it from .cspell/overrides.yml, if desired.
##
## You can also remove it from the list below, but your edit will be undone
## whenever this file is regenerated.
