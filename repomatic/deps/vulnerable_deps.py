"""Vulnerability audit and remediation for locked dependencies.

Backs the `audit` command and the `fix-vulnerable-deps` job: queries the
advisory sources enabled in `[tool.repomatic] vulnerable-deps.sources`,
unions and deduplicates their findings into {class}`VulnerablePackage`
records, and (`--fix`) upgrades each fixable package through uv.

Two advisory sources are consulted:

- `uv audit` queries the [PyPA Advisory
  Database](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database) (OSV-backed).
- GitHub's Dependabot alerts query the [GitHub Advisory
  Database](https://github.com/advisories) (GHSA).

Coverage diverges in practice: GHSA frequently lists a CVE before the PyPA
database mirrors it, and transitive lockfile vulnerabilities sometimes only
surface in GHSA. By unioning both sources, `audit` catches CVEs that either
database alone would miss.
