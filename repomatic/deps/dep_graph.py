"""Generate Mermaid dependency graphs from uv lockfiles.

Every box in the graph (the primary dependencies rectangle and each
`--group`/`--extra` subgraph) only holds directly-declared dependencies,
drawn as hexagons: the packages under the project's control, referenced in
`pyproject.toml`. Transitive dependencies always render outside the boxes,
as plain ovals.

```{note}
Uses `uv export --format cyclonedx1.5` which provides structured JSON
with dependency relationships, replacing the need for pipdeptree.
```

```{warning}
The generated Mermaid syntax targets the version bundled with
`sphinxcontrib-mermaid`, currently `11.12.1`. See the hard-coded
`MERMAID_VERSION` constant in [sphinxcontrib-mermaid's source](https://github.com/mgaitan/sphinxcontrib-mermaid/blob/master/sphinxcontrib/mermaid/__init__.py).
Avoid using Mermaid features introduced after that version.

    Boxes only hold the packages their group/extra declares directly;

    graph node can live in only one: the declarer whose closure holds the most

    arrows point where the package is consumed and the busiest box is its most
    natural home. The root is not a dependent, as it reaches every declared
    package by definition.

    box still shows the dependency it exists to install (rendered as a
    display-only duplicate node by {func}`render_mermaid`). For example the
    `carapace` and `yaml` extras both declare only `pyyaml`, which no other
