"""Swap git-tracked dependencies back to their released versions, and refuse
to release while one is still in place.

Two halves, both about where a dependency actually comes from.

The `sync-dep-sources` updater manages one precise idiom: a dependency
temporarily consumed from a git branch while its next release is awaited.
The idiom is machine-recognizable because it pairs two declarations in
`pyproject.toml`:

- a `[tool.uv.sources]` entry tracking a **branch** (not a `rev` or `tag`
  pin), and
- a dev-version floor on the same package (like `mango>=2.1.0.dev0`), whose
  base version names the awaited release.

Once the awaited release ships on the index, the swap rewrites the project
back to released artifacts: the source override is dropped, the `.dev` floor
is tightened to its base release, and a cooldown-bypass freeze adopts the
release through the `exclude-newer` window (the same deliberate-bypass
mechanism `audit --fix` uses for security fixes). The freeze then ages out
and is pruned by the ordinary `sync-uv-lock` lifecycle.

```{note}
The dev floor is authoritative, deliberately: the project *declares* that
anything from the awaited release onward satisfies it. If the project
quietly grew a dependency on branch commits newer than the release, the swap
PR's CI run exposes the stale declaration, and the correction (bumping the
floor to the next `.dev` version, which retracts the swap on the next run)
is exactly the fix the project needed anyway. Overrides outside the idiom
(path or workspace sources, `rev`/`tag` pins, floor-less branch tracks) are
never touched.
```

The `lint-deps` gate is the other half, and it covers what the swap does not.
A dependency is **shippable** when whoever installs the published artifact from
an index gets the same code the release was tested against. {func}`scan_project`
reports every way that breaks, and the release lane refuses to build a package
while one stands. See {class}`DepFinding` for the failure classes, and
`docs/dependencies.md` § Shippable sources for the worked example.
