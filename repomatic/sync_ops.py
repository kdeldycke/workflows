"""Registry of the cooldown-respecting dependency updaters, and their driver.

The five `sync-*` dependency bumpers (`sync-dep-sources`, `sync-uv-lock`,
`sync-tool-versions`, `sync-action-pins`, `sync-workflow-pins`) share a shape:
discover the latest eligible upstream version, gated by the
`[tool.repomatic] minimum-release-age` cooldown (or uv's `exclude-newer` for
the lock), then rewrite the pin. This module turns that shape into data: one
{class}`SyncOperation` per bumper, in {data}`SYNC_OPERATIONS`.

The registry is the single source of truth consumed three ways: the thin
`sync-*` commands and the aggregate `sync-deps` command in {mod}`repomatic.cli.main`,
and the consolidated CI job emitted by {mod}`repomatic.github.workflow_sync`.

```{rubric} Resolve then apply
```

Each operation splits into a read phase and a write phase so `sync-deps` can run
the slow, network-bound discovery for every operation concurrently, then write
serially:

- {attr}`SyncOperation.resolve` performs the network discovery and computes the
  new file contents in memory, returning a {class}`SyncPlan`. It does not touch
  the repository, so the resolves are safe to run in parallel.
- {attr}`SyncOperation.apply` writes the planned contents. Three of the five
  operations rewrite `.github/workflows/*.yaml` (action pins, workflow literals,
  and the actionlint matcher URL all live there), so applies must run serially.

`sync-uv-lock` and `sync-dep-sources` are the documented exceptions: their
discovery *is* a mutation (`uv lock` rewrites `uv.lock`), so their
{attr}`SyncOperation.resolve` writes during the parallel phase and their
{attr}`SyncOperation.apply` is a no-op. Their shared write domain (`uv.lock`,
`pyproject.toml`) is disjoint from every other operation's, and the two are
serialized against each other through {data}`_UV_PROJECT_MUTEX`. A `--dry-run`
resolve snapshots and restores the mutated files so the preview leaves no
trace.

The datasource adapters, version selection, and pure string rewriters live in
{mod}`repomatic.release.version_sync` and {mod}`repomatic.deps.uv`; this module composes them
with the file I/O and checksum recompute. Terminal and PR-body rendering stay in
{mod}`repomatic.cli.main`, fed from the {class}`SyncPlan`.
