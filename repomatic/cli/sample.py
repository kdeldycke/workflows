    Reads every subject through whichever API its host speaks (GitHub, GitLab
    or Forgejo) and appends one row per subject, metric and date. A counter
    like the star count accrues, so its curve can be charted; an attribute like
    the date of the newest commit keeps a single row, restamped only when it
    moves.

    GitHub restricted its stargazer endpoints to a repository's own admins in
    2026, which left every third-party star chart on the web rendering an error
    card. It reopened an anonymous star history later that year, and this reads
    it on a schedule and commits the result: a history that accrues locally
    cannot be revoked.

    Each reading records where it came from, since the curves are not all
    measured the same way. A GitHub repository has its whole curve rebuilt from
    that star history, which counts the stars it still holds; every other forge
    is sampled forward, one reading per run.
