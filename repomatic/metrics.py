"""Accumulate what forges say about a set of repositories, one reading at a time.

Every reading is one row of one table: which repository, which metric, on which
date, what it said, and where the figure came from. A new metric is a
{class}`Metric` entry and one line in the forge reader, not a new file, a new
schema or a new command.

```{note}
How long a reading is kept is a property of the metric, not of the caller.

A **counter** accrues: its whole point is the curve, so every dated reading is
kept and charted. A star count is the one that motivated all this.

An **attribute** does not: the date of a project's newest commit is a fact
about today, nothing reads it chronologically, and a hundred subjects sampled
weekly would pile up thousands of rows a year that no page ever opens. Only the
newest reading is kept, dated when the value last *moved*, so a quiet week
leaves the file untouched rather than restamping every row.

{class}`Retention` is where that choice lives, and {func}`upsert` is the only
code that has to know about it.
```

```{note}
The star history replaces the third-party charts a project used to embed. On
2026-06-30 GitHub restricted the REST stargazer endpoints to a repository's own
admins and collaborators, and closed the equivalent GraphQL field on
2026-07-17, which left every such embed on the web rendering an error card.

GitHub reopened the aggregate half on 2026-09-04, as a star-history endpoint
reporting counts per day without naming a single account. It needs no token and
answers for any public repository, so a curve no longer depends on who holds
the credentials. Sampling still runs on a schedule, because a history that
accrues in the repository cannot be revoked upstream.
```

```{warning}
A reconstruction and a sample do not measure the same thing, and the difference
is deliberate rather than a defect.

GitHub builds the star history from the accounts that *still* have the
repository starred, so a reconstruction attributes today's surviving stars to
the dates they were given: it understates every past date by the number of
stars since withdrawn, converging on the true figure at the present day. Kept
on purpose, since a curve that sags where a project shed followers carries a
signal a monotonic one hides. Each row therefore names its {data}`SOURCES`, so
a reader can always tell which question a point answers.

    one withdrawal in 2019 lowers every later point, and at daily resolution a
    single unstar rewrites thousands of committed rows. A week is also the
    cadence the job samples at and the unit the charts plot over years.

    GitHub buckets the days in its own timezone, `America/Los_Angeles`, and
    honours daylight saving. Measured against 612 exact star timestamps, that
    zone puts every one of them in the bucket the endpoint reported, where
    reading the days as UTC misplaces about a fifth of them by one day.

    Honouring it needs no conversion: a week's `week` field is midnight UTC on
    the Sunday *labelling* that Los Angeles week, so the calendar date of that
    instant plus a day's offset is already the local day. Converting the
    timestamp into a zone would reintroduce the error.
