"""Repository label management.

The label domain in one place: matching an issue or pull request against the
`[tool.repomatic.labels]` rules to decide which labels it earns, and applying
label definitions to a repository through `labelmaker`. Backs the
`apply-labels` and `sync-labels` commands.

A rule is one label mapped to a list of patterns: regexes or keywords over the
thread's text ({data}`DEFAULT_CONTENT_RULES`), globs over a pull request's
changed paths ({data}`DEFAULT_FILE_RULES`). Any pattern matching applies the
label. A project entry for a label replaces the default entry wholesale, and
an empty list disables it; see {func}`resolve_content_rules`.

```{note}
This schema replaced the `actions/labeler` v5 and `github/issue-labeler`
dialects when the matching moved in-tree. The retired shapes earned their
complexity serving the actions (per-matcher quantifiers, branch regexes,
`any`/`all` group nesting, per-pattern AND-joins), and none of it was used by
any repository this toolkit manages: every real rule was "label X when any
changed file matches any of these globs" or "when any of these words appears",
which is exactly what the schema now says and nothing more.

that `repomatic/data/labels.toml` defines, or the labelling call fails on a
label GitHub does not have; `tests/test_labels.py` enforces that.

Tune for precision, not recall: a missing label costs one manual click, a
wrong one is noise on every issue that trips it. Never key a rule off a token
the project prints in its own output, or a user pasting a trace sets every
label at once.

```{note}
`💖 sponsor` deliberately has no rule here, nor in {data}`DEFAULT_FILE_RULES`.
It means "a sponsor is involved", which is a fact about the author that only
the GraphQL sponsorship query can establish, and `sponsor-label` applies it
from exactly that. Matching the *words* "funding" or "sponsor" (or a pull
request touching `.github/funding.yml`) labels the topic instead, so anyone
opening "Add a funding.yml" read as a sponsor. Precision-first means no rule
beats an ambiguous one when an authoritative source already exists.
