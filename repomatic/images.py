"""Image optimization using external CLI tools.

Replaces the Docker-based ``calibreapp/image-actions`` GitHub Action with direct
invocations of lightweight CLI tools, removing the Docker dependency and enabling
``ubuntu-slim`` runners.

Tools used per format:

- PNG: ``oxipng`` (lossless, multithreaded Rust optimizer).
- JPEG/JPG: ``jpegoptim`` (lossless Huffman optimization + metadata stripping).

.. note::
    Both tools are strictly **lossless**: ``oxipng`` finds optimal PNG encoding
    parameters without altering pixel data, and ``jpegoptim`` (without ``-m``)
    rewrites Huffman tables only. This means optimization is **idempotent** — a
    second run produces no further changes, so the workflow never creates noisy
    PRs for negligible savings.

.. warning::
    WebP and AVIF are intentionally **not** optimized. The only available tools
    (``cwebp``, ``avifenc``) work by lossy re-encoding: decode → re-compress at
    a target quality. This is **not idempotent** — each pass re-compresses the
    previous output, producing progressively smaller (and worse) files. The
    earlier ``calibreapp/image-actions`` suffered from this: it required multiple
    workflow runs to stabilize below the savings threshold, generating repeated
    PRs with diminishing returns and cumulative quality loss. Lossless WebP/AVIF
    modes exist but typically *increase* file size when applied to already
    lossy-encoded images, making them counterproductive. Since WebP and AVIF are
    modern formats chosen specifically for their compression efficiency, files in
    these formats are almost always already well-optimized at creation time.
