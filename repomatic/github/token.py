"""GitHub token validation utilities.

Provides early validation for CLI commands that depend on the GitHub API,
so users get clear error messages at startup rather than opaque failures
mid-execution.

.. note:: Why ``REPOMATIC_PAT`` is needed

   GitHub's ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` cannot modify workflow files in ``.github/``.
   Neither ``contents: write``, ``actions: write``, nor ``permissions:
   write-all`` grant this ability. The only way to push changes to workflow
   YAML files is via a fine-grained Personal Access Token with the
   **Workflows** permission. Without it, pushes are rejected with::

       ! [remote rejected] branch_xxx -> branch_xxx (refusing to allow a
       GitHub App to create or update workflow
       `.github/workflows/my_workflow.yaml` without `workflows` permission)

   Additionally, events triggered by ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` do not start new
   workflow runs (see `GitHub docs
   <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow>`_),
   so tag pushes also need the PAT to trigger downstream workflows.

   The **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** setting has
   no effect on this limitation — it's a hard security boundary enforced by
   GitHub regardless of repository-level settings.

   Jobs that use ``REPOMATIC_PAT``:

   - ``autofix.yaml``: fix-typos, sync-repomatic
     (PRs touching ``.github/workflows/`` files).
   - ``changelog.yaml``: prepare-release (freezes versions in workflow files).
   - ``release.yaml``: create-tag (push triggers ``on.push.tags``),
     create-release (triggers downstream workflows).
   - ``renovate.yaml``: renovate (dependency PRs, status checks, dashboard,
     vulnerability alerts).

   All jobs fall back to ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` when the PAT is unavailable
   (``secrets.REPOMATIC_PAT || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN``), but
   operations requiring the ``workflows`` permission or workflow triggering
   will silently fail.

   Token permission mapping:

   - **Workflows** — PRs that touch ``.github/workflows/`` files.
   - **Contents** — Tag pushes, release publishing, PR branch creation.
   - **Pull requests** — All PR-creating jobs.
   - **Commit statuses** — Renovate ``stability-days`` status checks.
   - **Dependabot alerts** — Renovate vulnerability alert reading.
   - **Issues** — Renovate Dependency Dashboard.
   - **Metadata** — Required for all fine-grained token API operations.
