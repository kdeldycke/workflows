"""GitHub issue lifecycle management.

Generic primitives for listing, creating, updating, closing, and triaging
GitHub issues via the ``gh`` CLI. Used by :mod:`broken_links` and potentially
other modules that manage bot-created issues.

We need to manually manage the life-cycle of issues created in CI jobs because the
``create-issue-from-file`` action blindly creates issues ad-nauseam.

See:
- https://github.com/peter-evans/create-issue-from-file/issues/298
- https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action/issues/74#issuecomment-1587089689
