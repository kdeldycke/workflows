"""Generation, sync, and lint for downstream workflows.

Downstream repositories consuming reusable workflows from `kdeldycke/repomatic`
manually write caller workflows that often miss triggers like
`workflow_dispatch`. This module provides tools to generate, synchronize, and
lint those callers by parsing the canonical workflow definitions.

{func}`render_thin_caller_for_target` is the single entry point that turns a
canonical workflow into a downstream file on disk; `repomatic init` drives it.

Generating and reshaping workflow content in Python, rather than
hand-maintaining YAML, keeps logic out of the platform-specific GitHub Actions
surface: a tested generator that fails loudly beats a static YAML artifact that
can silently drift, and the smaller GHA surface eases a future migration to
another CI platform. `_render_publish_pypi_job` derives each downstream
`publish-pypi` job from the canonical `release.yaml` this way.

```{caution}
PyYAML destroys formatting and comments on round-trip. Until we find a
layout-preserving YAML parsing and rendering solution, we use raw text
extraction to manipulate workflow files while preserving formatting and
comments.
```

```{todo}
Swap the two reusable-workflow lanes in `release.yaml` to GitHub's `$/`
self-repository syntax, and drop their suppression, once actionlint accepts
the form: it rejects `$/` as a malformed ref today, per
[rhysd/actionlint#711](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/711) and
[rhysd/actionlint#732](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/732). The
`publish-pypi` step keeps `./` either way, since `$/` resolves against the
workflow's own commit rather than the release commit it checks out.

    """Generate the downstream `release.yaml` caller from the canonical entry.

    The canonical `release.yaml` (bundled, repomatic's own self-release entry) is
    a multi-job caller: a `build` lane call, the OIDC `publish-pypi` job, and a
    `release` engine call. Downstream repos get the same shape with:

    - **Standard release triggers synthesized** (`push` to `main` +
      `workflow_dispatch`), so a dogfooding-only trigger added upstream never
      leaks downstream. The canonical entry's `schedule` is the one trigger
      carried over: ordinary pushes only compile the `nuitka.dev-targets`
      canary, so the weekly run is what rebuilds every binary target (and
      keeps each target's compile cache warm) downstream too.
    - **Concurrency carried over** from the canonical entry verbatim, so
      superseded non-release runs cancel downstream too. The block must sit on
      this push-triggered caller (not the engine lane it calls via `needs:`,
      whose group joins too late to cancel queued runs); see docs/workflows.md.
    - **Deny-by-default `permissions: {}`** emitted like the canonical entry
      carries it, so a downstream job added below the managed lanes starts with
      no scopes instead of inheriting the repository default.
    - **Downstream `needs:` edges preserved** on the `release` lane (see
      :func:`_downstream_release_needs`), so a consumer gating the engine on its
      own asset-building job keeps that edge across a sync.
    - **Local `uses: ./` refs rewritten** to the pinned cross-repo form
      (`{repo}/.github/workflows/{name}@{ref}`) for the `build` and `release`
      lanes, with their repomatic-specific comments stripped.
    - **The `publish-pypi` job reshaped** by :func:`_render_publish_pypi_job`
      (checkout dropped, action ref pinned). Keeping it in `release.yaml` is what
      makes the OIDC `job_workflow_ref` resolve to each repo's own `release.yaml`
      (see pypi/warehouse#11096).

    Copying the rest keeps the `build`/`publish-pypi`/`release` wiring
