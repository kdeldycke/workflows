"""GitHub Advisory Database (GHSA) client for Dependabot alerts.

Reads the open Dependabot alerts on a repository and converts them into the
{class}`~repomatic.uv.VulnerablePackage` shape consumed by
{func}`~repomatic.uv.fix_vulnerable_deps`. Used as a second advisory source
alongside `uv audit`.

```{note} Why GHSA in addition to `uv audit`

`uv audit` queries the [PyPA Advisory
Database](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database) (OSV-backed). GitHub's
Dependabot alerts query the [GitHub Advisory
Database](https://github.com/advisories) (GHSA). Coverage diverges in
practice: GHSA frequently lists a CVE before the PyPA database mirrors it,
and transitive lockfile vulnerabilities sometimes only surface in GHSA. By
unioning both sources, `fix-vulnerable-deps` catches CVEs that either
database alone would miss.
```
