"""Sync a rolling dev pre-release on GitHub.

Maintains a single **draft** pre-release that mirrors the unreleased
changelog section and always carries the latest successful dev binaries
and Python package. The dev tag (e.g. ``v6.1.1.dev0``) is force-updated
to point to the latest ``main`` commit — no tag proliferation.

.. note::
    Dev releases are created as **drafts** so they remain mutable even
    when GitHub's immutable releases setting is enabled. Immutability
    only blocks **asset uploads** on published releases — deletion still
    works. But because the workflow needs to upload binaries *after*
    creation, the release must stay as a draft throughout its lifetime
    to allow asset uploads. See ``CLAUDE.md`` § Immutable releases.
