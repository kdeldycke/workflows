"""Check if a GitHub user is a sponsor of another user or organization.

Uses the GitHub GraphQL API via the `gh` CLI to query sponsorship data.
Supports both user and organization owners, with pagination for accounts
that have more than 100 sponsors.

When run in GitHub Actions, the owner defaults to
{class}`~repomatic.metadata.core.Metadata`'s view of the repository; the author
and issue/PR number come from the event-payload readers in
{mod}`~repomatic.github.actions`.
