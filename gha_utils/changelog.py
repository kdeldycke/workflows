        This is designed to be used just after a new release has been tagged. And before a
        post-release version increment is applied with a call to:

        ```shell-session
        $ bump-my-version bump --verbose patch
        Starting BumpVersion 0.5.1.dev6
        Reading config file pyproject.toml:
        Specified version (2.17.5) does not match last tagged version (2.17.4)
        Parsing version '2.17.5' using '(?P<major>\\d+)\\.(?P<minor>\\d+)\\.(?P<patch>\\d+)'
        Parsed the following values: major=2, minor=17, patch=5
        Attempting to increment part 'patch'
        Values are now: major=2, minor=17, patch=6
        New version will be '2.17.6'
        Dry run active, won't touch any files.
        Asserting files ./changelog.md contain the version string...
