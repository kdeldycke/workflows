# {octicon}`shield-lock` Security

## Supply chain security

`repomatic` implements most of the practices described in Astral's [Open Source Security at Astral](https://astral.sh/blog/open-source-security-at-astral) post, baked into a drop-in setup that any maintainer can inherit by pointing their workflows at the reusable callers.

> [!WARNING]
> **Known gap: multi-person release approval.** Astral gates releases behind a dedicated [GitHub deployment environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/reviewing-deployments) with required reviewers, so that a single compromised account cannot publish. `repomatic` does not enforce this, but if the repository has multiple maintainers, I recommend adding an `environment: release` key to the `publish-pypi` and `create-release` jobs in a downstream caller workflow and configuring required reviewers on that environment in repo settings.

### Third-party action minimization

Every third-party GitHub Action executes with access to `GITHUB_TOKEN` and repository secrets. Each action is a trust delegation: you depend on the maintainer's security practices, their CI pipeline, and their transitive dependencies. A compromised action can steal secrets, inject code into builds, or tamper with releases.

`repomatic` has systematically eliminated 18 third-party actions since late 2025, replacing them with internal CLI commands, SHA-256-verified binary downloads, and runner built-in tools:

| Removed action | Replacement | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `calibreapp/image-actions` | `repomatic format-images` | Internal CLI |
| `crazy-max/ghaction-virustotal` | `repomatic scan-virustotal` | Internal CLI |
| `AndreasAugustin/actions-template-sync` | `repomatic sync-awesome-template` | Internal CLI |
| `JasonEtco/is-sponsor-label-action` | `repomatic sponsor-label` | Internal CLI |
| `lycheeverse/lychee-action` | `repomatic run lychee` | Direct binary + SHA-256 |
| `crate-ci/typos` | `repomatic run typos` | Direct binary + SHA-256 |
| `biomejs/setup-biome` | `repomatic run biome` | Direct binary + SHA-256 |
| `gitleaks/gitleaks-action` | `repomatic run gitleaks` | Direct binary + SHA-256 |
| `julb/action-manage-label` | `repomatic run labelmaker` | Direct binary + SHA-256 |
| `taiki-e/install-action` | Direct `curl` + checksum | Direct binary + SHA-256 |
| `softprops/action-gh-release` | `gh release create` | Runner built-in |
| `actions/github-script` | Bash + `gh` CLI | Runner built-in |
| `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain` | Runner built-in Rust | Runner built-in |
| `actions/setup-python` | `astral-sh/setup-uv` | Consolidated |
| `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` | `actions/deploy-pages` | First-party replacement |
| `codecov/codecov-action` | `codecov-cli` via `uvx` | Pinned CLI |
| `codecov/test-results-action` | `codecov-cli` via `uvx` | Pinned CLI |
| `GitHubSecurityLab/actions-permissions` | Explicit `permissions:` key | Removed entirely |

The remaining third-party actions (5 of 14 total) are:

| Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `astral-sh/setup-uv` | Core toolchain: installs `uv` |
| `peter-evans/create-pull-request` | Creates autofix PRs |
| `dessant/lock-threads` | Locks inactive issues |
| `renovatebot/github-action` | Dependency updates |
| `crazy-max/ghaction-dump-context` | Debug diagnostics (no secrets access) |

Replacement strategies, ordered from most to least isolated:

1. **Internal CLI**: the operation runs inside `repomatic` Python code with no external process.
2. **Direct binary download**: checksummed binary fetched from a GitHub release URL, no action code path involved.
3. **Runner built-in**: uses tools pre-installed on the GitHub Actions runner (`gh`, Rust toolchain).
4. **First-party replacement**: swaps a community action for an official `actions/*` equivalent maintained by GitHub.

### Ruff consolidation

Eight separate Python linters and formatters have been absorbed into `ruff`, eliminating eight runtime or dev dependencies:

| Removed tool | What it did | Replaced |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pylint` | Static analysis and linting | Feb 2023 |
| `pydocstyle` | Docstring convention enforcement | Feb 2023 |
| `pycln` | Unused import removal | Feb 2023 |
| `pyupgrade` | Python syntax modernization | Feb 2023 |
| `isort` | Import sorting | Feb 2023 |
| `black` | Code formatting | Sep 2023 |
| `docformatter` | Docstring formatting | Jan 2024 |
| `blacken-docs` | Python formatting in Markdown code blocks | Feb 2026 |

The `mdformat-black` plugin was also swapped for `mdformat-ruff` (Aug 2024): same dependency count, but aligns the Markdown pipeline with ruff's formatting rules.

`autopep8` is the only legacy formatter still in use: it handles long-line comment wrapping that ruff does not yet cover.

### uv consolidation

Five separate packaging and install tools have been absorbed into `uv`, which now handles dependency management, builds, publishing, auditing, and Python version installation:

| Removed tool | What it did | Replaced |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `poetry` | Dependency management, lock files, virtual environments | Jun 2024 |
| `build` / `python -m build` | Package building (wheels and sdists) | Sep 2024 |
| `twine` | PyPI uploads | Jan 2025 |
| `check-wheel-contents` | Wheel validation | Jan 2025 |
| `pip-audit` | Vulnerability scanning | Mar 2026 |

`uv` also consolidated command-line usage that previously required separate tools: `pip install` became `uv pip install` / `uv sync`, `pipx` became `uvx`, and `actions/setup-python` was replaced by `astral-sh/setup-uv` (counted in the [action minimization table](#third-party-action-minimization) above).

Two other Python packages were eliminated outside the ruff/uv consolidations: `pipdeptree` (replaced by an internal `deps-graph` implementation) and `gitignore-parser` (replaced by `py-walk`).

## Permissions and token

Several workflows need a `REPOMATIC_PAT` secret to create PRs that modify files in `.github/workflows/` and to trigger downstream workflows. Without it, those jobs silently fall back to the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which lacks the required permissions.

After your first push, the [`setup-guide` job](workflows.md#github-workflows-autofix-yaml-jobs) automatically opens an issue with [step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/templates/setup-guide.md) to create and configure the token.

## Concurrency and cancellation

All workflows use a `concurrency` directive to prevent redundant runs and save CI resources. When a new commit is pushed, any in-progress workflow runs for the same branch or PR are automatically cancelled.

Workflows are grouped by:

- **Pull requests**: `{workflow-name}-{pr-number}` — Multiple commits to the same PR cancel previous runs
- **Branch pushes**: `{workflow-name}-{branch-ref}` — Multiple pushes to the same branch cancel previous runs

`release.yaml` uses a stronger protection: release commits get a **unique concurrency group** based on the commit SHA, so they can never be cancelled. This ensures tagging, PyPI publishing, and GitHub release creation complete successfully.

Additionally, [`cancel-runs.yaml`](workflows.md#github-workflows-cancel-runs-yaml-jobs) actively cancels in-progress and queued runs when a PR is closed. This complements passive concurrency groups, which only trigger cancellation when a *new* run enters the same group — closing a PR doesn't produce such an event.

> [!TIP]
> For implementation details on how concurrency groups are computed and why `release.yaml` needs special handling, see the [`repomatic.github.actions`](repomatic.github.html#module-repomatic.github.actions) module docstring.

## AV false-positive submissions

Compiled Python binaries (built with [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) `--onefile`) are frequently flagged as malicious by heuristic AV engines. The onefile packaging technique (self-extracting archive with embedded Python runtime) triggers generic "packed/suspicious" signatures. This is a known issue across the Nuitka ecosystem.

The [`scan-virustotal`](workflows.md#github-workflows-release-yaml-jobs) job in `release.yaml` uploads all compiled binaries to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) on every release. This seeds AV vendor databases to reduce false positive rates for downstream distributors (Chocolatey, Scoop, etc.).

When a release is flagged, the `/av-false-positive` [skill](skills.md) generates per-vendor submission files with pre-written text and form field mappings. The vendor details below document the process for manual reference.

### Submission priority

Submit in this order to maximize impact:

1. **Microsoft**: most influential engine. ML detections (`Sabsik`, `Wacatac`) have the broadest downstream effect.
2. **BitDefender**: powers ~6 downstream vendor engines. Highest detection-removal-per-submission ratio.
3. **ESET**: email-based channel with no portal dependency. The most reliable submission path.
4. **Symantec**: ML detections (`ML.Attribute.*`) may take longer to process.
5. **Avast/AVG**: shared engine, so one submission covers both.
6. **Sophos**: PUA detections require justification of the software's legitimate purpose.

### Submission content

Every false-positive submission should include:

- The binary's VirusTotal report link.
- VirusTotal links for the clean `.whl` and `.tar.gz` source distributions (as comparison evidence).
- The GitHub release link and direct download URL for the binary.
- Project homepage and PyPI URL.
- License from `pyproject.toml`.
- Reference to any prior false-positive issue in the repository.

All submission text should mention that the binary is compiled with Nuitka `--onefile` from an open-source project.

### Known portal issues

- **Microsoft**: CORS errors or stuck progress modals during upload (auth session expiring). Workaround: sign out, clear cookies for `microsoft.com`, sign back in, submit immediately.
- **BitDefender**: form sometimes returns "Your request could not be registered!" with no details. Retry later.
- **Avast**: form sometimes returns "An internal error occurred while sending the form." Retry later.
