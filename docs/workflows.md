# {octicon}`workflow` Reusable workflows

The `repomatic` CLI operates in CI through [reusable GitHub Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows). You configure behavior via [`[tool.repomatic]`](configuration.md) in `pyproject.toml`; the workflows are the execution layer.

### Example usage

The fastest way to adopt these workflows is with `repomatic init` (see [Quick start](install.md#quick-start)). It generates all the thin-caller workflow files for you.

If you prefer to set up a single workflow manually, create a `.github/workflows/lint.yaml` file [using the `uses` syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow):

```yaml
name: Lint
on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  lint:
    uses: kdeldycke/repomatic/.github/workflows/lint.yaml@v6.9.0
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Concurrency is already configured](security.md#concurrency-and-cancellation) in the reusable workflows—you don't need to re-specify it in your calling workflow.

### GitHub Actions limitations

GitHub Actions has several design limitations that the workflows work around:

| Limitation                                                                                                                                                                       | Status             | Addressed by                                                                                                                                                         |

### 🪄 [`.github/workflows/autofix.yaml` jobs](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/.github/workflows/autofix.yaml)

*Setup* — guide new users through initial configuration:

#### 📖 Setup guide (`setup-guide`)

- Detects missing `REPOMATIC_PAT` secret and opens an issue with step-by-step setup instructions
- When the PAT is present, validates all required permissions (contents, issues, pull requests, Dependabot alerts, workflows, commit statuses) using the same checks as `lint-repo`
- Keeps the issue open with a diagnostic table when the PAT exists but permissions are incomplete
- When Nuitka binary compilation is active, includes a VirusTotal API key setup step and keeps the issue open until the key is configured
- Automatically closes the issue once the secret is configured and all permissions are verified
- **Skipped if**:
  - upstream `kdeldycke/repomatic` repo, `workflow_call` events
  - `setup-guide = false` in `[tool.repomatic]`

*Formatters* — rewrite files to enforce canonical style:

#### 🐍 Format Python (`format-python`)

- **Requires**:
  - Python files (`**/*.{py,pyi,pyw,pyx,ipynb}`) in the repository, or
  - documentation files (`**/*.{markdown,mdown,mkdn,mdwn,mkd,md,mdtxt,mdtext,mdx,rst,tex}`)

#### 📐 Format `pyproject.toml` (`format-pyproject`)

  - Python package with a `pyproject.toml` file

#### ✍️ Format Markdown (`format-markdown`)

- Auto-formats Markdown files using [`mdformat`](https://github.com/hukkin/mdformat)
- **Requires**:
  - Markdown files (`**/*.{markdown,mdown,mkdn,mdwn,mkd,md,mdtxt,mdtext,mdx}`) in the repository

#### 🐚 Format Shell (`format-shell`)

- Auto-formats shell scripts using [`shfmt`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh)
- **Requires**:
  - Shell files (`**/*.{bash,bats,ksh,mksh,sh,zsh}`) or shell dotfiles (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) in the repository

#### 🔧 Format JSON (`format-json`)

- Auto-formats JSON, JSONC, and JSON5 files using [Biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome)
- **Requires**:
  - JSON files (`**/*.{json,jsonc,json5}`, `**/.code-workspace`, `!**/package-lock.json`) in the repository

*Fixers* — correct or improve existing content in-place:

#### ✏️ Fix typos (`fix-typos`)

- Automatically fixes typos in the codebase using [`typos`](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos)

#### 🛡️ Fix vulnerable dependencies (`fix-vulnerable-deps`)

- Detects vulnerable packages from two advisory sources, unioned and deduplicated by `(package, advisory_id)`:
  - [`uv audit`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-audit) against the [Python Packaging Advisory Database](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database) (OSV-backed). Works locally and in CI without a GitHub token.
  - The repository's [Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) feed against the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories). Catches CVEs (including transitive `uv.lock` packages) that the PyPA database has not yet ingested.
- Uses `uv lock --upgrade-package` with [`--exclude-newer-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#exclude-newer-package) bypass to resolve fix versions that may be within the [`exclude-newer`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#exclude-newer) cooldown period
- PR body includes a table of vulnerabilities (with the source database that surfaced each one) and updated package versions with release notes
- **Requires**:
  - Python package (with a `pyproject.toml` file)
  - For the GitHub Advisory Database source: a token with `Dependabot alerts: Read-only` permission (`REPOMATIC_PAT` or the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN`) and Dependabot alerts enabled on the repository
- **Skipped if**:
  - `vulnerable-deps.sync = false` in `[tool.repomatic]`

#### 🖼️ Format images (`format-images`)

- Losslessly compresses PNG and JPEG images using [`repomatic format-images`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/images.py) with `oxipng` and `jpegoptim`
- Skips files where savings are below `--min-savings` (percentage, default 5%) or `--min-savings-bytes` (absolute, default 1024 bytes)
- **Requires**:
  - Image files (`**/*.{jpeg,jpg,png,webp,avif}`) in the repository

*Syncers* — regenerate files from external sources or project state:

#### 🙈 Sync `.gitignore` (`sync-gitignore`)

- Regenerates `.gitignore` from [gitignore.io](https://github.com/toptal/gitignore.io) templates using [`repomatic sync-gitignore`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/cli.py)
- **Requires**:
  - A `.gitignore` file in the repository
- **Skipped if**:
  - `gitignore.sync = false` in `[tool.repomatic]`

#### 🔄 Sync bumpversion config (`sync-bumpversion`)

- Syncs the `[tool.bumpversion]` configuration in `pyproject.toml` using [`repomatic sync-bumpversion`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/cli.py)
- **Skipped if**:
  - `[tool.bumpversion]` section already exists in `pyproject.toml`
  - `bumpversion.sync = false` in `[tool.repomatic]`

#### 🔄 Sync repomatic (`sync-repomatic`)

- Runs [`repomatic init --delete-unmodified --delete-excluded`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/init_project.py) to sync all repomatic-managed files: thin-caller workflows, configuration files, and skill definitions
- Removes unmodified config files identical to bundled defaults and cleans up excluded or stale files (disabled opt-in workflows, auto-excluded skills)
- In the upstream repository, regenerates the bundled `repomatic/data/renovate.json5` from the root config (workflows are excluded via `[tool.repomatic]`)

#### 📬 Sync `.mailmap` (`sync-mailmap`)

- Keeps `.mailmap` file up to date with contributors using [`repomatic sync-mailmap`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/mailmap.py)
- **Requires**:
  - A `.mailmap` file in the repository root
- **Skipped if**:
  - `mailmap.sync = false` in `[tool.repomatic]`

#### ⛓️ Sync `uv.lock` (`sync-uv-lock`)

- Runs `uv lock --upgrade` to update transitive dependencies to their latest allowed versions using [`repomatic sync-uv-lock`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/renovate.py)
- Only creates a PR when the lock file contains real dependency changes (timestamp-only noise is detected and skipped)
- PR body includes a table of updated packages with version ranges linked to GitHub comparison diffs, plus collapsible release notes for all intermediate versions
- Replaces Renovate's `lockFileMaintenance`, which cannot reliably revert noise-only changes
- **Requires**:
  - Python package with a `pyproject.toml` file
- **Skipped if**:
  - `uv-lock.sync = false` in `[tool.repomatic]`

#### 🕸️ Update dependency graph (`update-deps-graph`)

- Generates a Mermaid dependency graph of the Python project using [`repomatic update-deps-graph`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/deps_graph.py)
- **Requires**:
  - Python package with a `uv.lock` file

#### 📚 Update docs (`update-docs`)

- Regenerates Sphinx autodoc files using [`sphinx-apidoc`](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx)
- Runs `docs/docs_update.py` if present to generate dynamic content (tables, diagrams, Sphinx directives)
- **Requires**:
  - Python package with a `pyproject.toml` file
  - `docs` dependency group
  - Sphinx autodoc enabled (checks for `sphinx.ext.autodoc` in `docs/conf.py`)

### 🔒 [`.github/workflows/autolock.yaml` jobs](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/.github/workflows/autolock.yaml)

#### 🔒 Lock inactive threads (`lock`)

- Automatically locks closed issues and PRs after 90 days of inactivity using [`lock-threads`](https://github.com/dessant/lock-threads)

### 🩺 [`.github/workflows/debug.yaml` jobs](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/.github/workflows/debug.yaml)

#### 🩺 Dump context (`dump-context`)

- Dumps GitHub Actions context and runner environment info across all build targets using [`ghaction-dump-context`](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-dump-context)
- Useful for debugging runner differences and CI environment issues
- **Runs on**:
  - Push to `main` (only when `debug.yaml` itself changes)
  - Monthly schedule
  - Manual dispatch
  - `workflow_call` from downstream repositories

(github-workflows-cancel-runs-yaml-jobs)=

### ✂️ [`.github/workflows/cancel-runs.yaml` jobs](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/.github/workflows/cancel-runs.yaml)

#### ✂️ Cancel PR runs (`cancel-runs`)

- Cancels all in-progress and queued workflow runs for a PR's branch when the PR is closed
- Prevents wasted CI resources from long-running jobs (e.g. Nuitka binary builds) that continue after a PR is closed
- GitHub Actions does not natively cancel runs on PR close — the `concurrency` mechanism only triggers cancellation when a *new* run enters the same group

(github-workflows-changelog-yaml-jobs)=

### 🆙 [`.github/workflows/changelog.yaml` jobs](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/.github/workflows/changelog.yaml)

#### 🆙 Bump version (`bump-version`)

- Creates PRs for minor and major version bumps using [`bump-my-version`](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version)
- Syncs `uv.lock` to include the new version in the same commit
- Uses commit message parsing as fallback when tags aren't available yet
- **Requires**:
  - `bump-my-version` configuration in `pyproject.toml`
  - A `changelog.md` file
- **Runs on**:
  - Schedule (daily at 6:00 UTC)
  - Manual dispatch
  - After `release.yaml` workflow completes successfully (via `workflow_run` trigger, to ensure tags exist before checking bump eligibility). Checks out the latest `main` HEAD, not the triggering workflow's commit.

#### 📋 Fix changelog (`fix-changelog`)

- Checks and fixes changelog dates, availability admonitions, and orphaned versions using [`repomatic lint-changelog --fix`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/changelog.py)
- **Runs on**:
  - Push to `main` (when `changelog.md`, `pyproject.toml`, or workflow files change). Skipped during release cycles.
  - After `release.yaml` workflow completes successfully (via `workflow_run` trigger), when the GitHub release is published and visible to the public API.

#### 🎬 Prepare release (`prepare-release`)

- Creates a release PR with two commits: a **freeze commit** that freezes everything to the release version, and an **unfreeze commit** that reverts to development references and bumps the patch version
- Uses [`bump-my-version`](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version) and [`repomatic changelog`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/changelog.py)

[Release Engineering is a full-time job, and full of edge-cases](https://web.archive.org/web/20250126113318/https://blog.axo.dev/2023/02/cargo-dist) that nobody wants to deal with. This workflow automates most of it for Python projects.

**Cross-platform binaries** — Targets 6 platform/architecture combinations (Linux/macOS/Windows × `x86_64`/`arm64`). Unstable targets use `continue-on-error` so builds don't fail on experimental platforms. Job names are prefixed with ✅ (stable, must pass) or ⁉️ (unstable, allowed to fail) for quick visual triage in the GitHub Actions UI.

#### 🧯 Detect squash merge (`detect-squash-merge`)

- Detects squash-merged release PRs, opens a GitHub issue to notify the maintainer, and fails the workflow
- The release is effectively skipped: `create-tag` only matches commits with the `[changelog] Release v` prefix, so no tag, PyPI publish, or GitHub release is created from a squash merge
- The net effect of squashing freeze + unfreeze leaves `main` in a valid state for the next development cycle; the maintainer just releases the next version when ready
- **Runs on**:
  - Push to `main` only

#### 📦 Build package (`build-package`)

- Builds Python wheel and sdist packages using [`uv build`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

- On release pushes, each binary generates an attestation and uploads itself to the GitHub release as its build completes
- **Requires**:
  - Python package with [CLI entry points](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#entry-points) defined in `pyproject.toml`
- **Skipped if** `[tool.repomatic] nuitka = false` is set in `pyproject.toml` (for projects with CLI entry points that don't need standalone binaries)

#### 🎉 Publish release (`publish-release`)

- Publishes the draft GitHub release after all assets have been uploaded
- Supports [GitHub immutable releases](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/immutable-releases): once published, tags and assets are locked
- Uses `always()` so it runs even when `compile-binaries` is skipped (non-binary projects) or partially fails (unstable platforms)
- **Requires**:
  - Successful `create-release` job (draft must exist)

#### 🛡️ VirusTotal scan (`scan-virustotal`)

- Uploads compiled binaries (`.bin` and `.exe`) to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) via `repomatic scan-virustotal`, then appends analysis links to the GitHub release body. A second step polls for analysis completion and replaces the table with detection statistics (`flagged / total` engine counts)

#### 🚚 Migrate to Renovate (`migrate-to-renovate`)

- Automatically migrates from Dependabot to Renovate by creating a PR that:
  - Exports `renovate.json5` configuration file (if missing)
  - Removes `.github/dependabot.yaml` or `.github/dependabot.yml` (if present)

- Verifies the package can be installed and all CLI entry points run correctly via every install method: `uvx`, `uvx --from`, `uv run --with`, module invocation (`-m`), `uv tool install`, and `pipx run`
- Tests both the latest PyPI release and the current `main` branch from GitHub
- Runs once on a single stable OS/Python — install correctness does not vary by platform
- **Requires**:
  - `cli_scripts` from `metadata` job (skipped if no `[project.scripts]` entries)

#### 🔬 Run tests (`tests`)

- Runs the test suite across a matrix of OS (Linux/macOS/Windows × `x86_64`/`arm64`) and Python versions (`3.10`, `3.14`, `3.14t`, `3.15`)
- Installs all optional extras (`--all-extras`) to catch incompatibilities between optional dependency groups

### 🔄 [`.github/workflows/update-checksums.yaml` jobs](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-checksums.yaml)

#### 🔄 Update checksums (`update-checksums`)

- Workaround for [renovatebot/renovate#42263](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/42263): Renovate's `postUpgradeTasks` silently drops file changes when the task modifies the same file the regex manager already updated
- Triggers when Renovate pushes a version bump to `repomatic/tool_runner.py` on a `renovate/**` branch
- Downloads each binary tool at its new version, computes the SHA-256, and commits the corrected checksums to the PR branch
- Uses `REPOMATIC_PAT` for the push so the fix commit re-triggers CI checks on the PR
- Safe against infinite loops: a second trigger finds all checksums already correct and exits without pushing
- **Source-repo only**: not bundled for downstream repos (they have no tool registry)

(what-is-this-metadata-job)=

### 🧬 What is this `metadata` job?

Most jobs in this repository depend on a shared parent job called `metadata`. It runs first to extract contextual information, reconcile and combine it, and expose it for downstream jobs to consume.

This expands the capabilities of GitHub Actions, since it allows to:

- Share complex data across jobs (like build matrix)
- Remove limitations of conditional jobs
- Allow for runner introspection
- Fix quirks (like missing environment variables, events/commits mismatch, merge commits, etc.)

This job relies on the [`repomatic metadata` command](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/repomatic/metadata.py) to gather data from multiple sources:

- **Git**: current branch, latest tag, commit messages, changed files
- **GitHub**: event type, actor, PR labels
- **Environment**: OS, architecture
- **`pyproject.toml`**: project name, version, entry points

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This flexibility comes at the cost of:
>
> - Making the whole workflow a bit more computationally intensive
> - Introducing a small delay at the beginning of the run
> - Preventing child jobs to run in parallel before its completion
>
> But is worth it given how [GitHub Actions can be frustrating](https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/06/github-actions-package-manager.html).

## How does it work?

### `uv` everywhere

All Python dependencies and CLIs are installed via [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for speed and reproducibility.

### Smart job skipping

Jobs are guarded by conditions to skip unnecessary steps: file type detection (only lint Python if `.py` files exist), branch filtering (`prepare-release` skipped for most linting), and bot detection.

### Dynamic test matrices

GitHub's `strategy.matrix` is a static Cartesian product: you list values per axis, optionally add or exclude fixed combinations, and that's it. There is no way to conditionally add dimensions, replace values in-place, or remove axis entries based on project configuration.

`repomatic` generates matrices dynamically in the [`metadata` job](#what-is-this-metadata-job), applying a chain of transformations that downstream projects control via [`[tool.repomatic.test-matrix]`](configuration.md):

1. `replace`: swap one axis value for another (e.g., pin a specific Python patch version).
2. `remove`: delete values from an axis entirely.
3. `variations`: add new dimensions or extend existing ones (full CI only, keeping PR feedback fast).
4. `exclude`: remove matching combinations, with partial matching across axes.
5. `include`: add or augment combinations, processed after excludes so they take priority.

Operations are applied in that order, so downstream projects can express matrix shapes that static YAML cannot: different dimensions for PR vs full CI, axis-level transformations without rewriting the entire matrix, and ordered operations that compose predictably.

### Maintainer-in-the-loop

Workflows never commit directly or act silently. Every proposed change creates a PR; every action needed opens an issue. You review and decide — nothing lands without your approval.

### Configurable with sensible defaults

Downstream projects customize behavior via [`[tool.repomatic]`](configuration.md) in `pyproject.toml`. Workflows also accept `inputs` for fine-tuning, but the configuration file is the primary interface.

### Idempotent operations

Safe to re-run: tag creation skips if already exists, version bumps have eligibility checks, PRs update existing branches.

### Graceful degradation

Fallback tokens (`secrets.REPOMATIC_PAT || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`) and `continue-on-error` for unstable targets. Job names use emoji prefixes for at-a-glance status: **✅** for stable jobs that must pass, **⁉️** for unstable jobs (e.g., experimental Python versions, unreleased platforms) that are expected to fail and won't block the workflow.

### Dogfooding

This repository uses these workflows for itself.

### Dependency strategy

All dependencies are pinned to specific versions for stability, reproducibility, and security.

#### Pinning mechanisms

| Mechanism                   | What it pins                | How it's updated  |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------- |
| `uv.lock`                   | Project dependencies        | Renovate PRs      |
| Hard-coded versions in YAML | GitHub Actions, npm, Python | Renovate PRs      |
| `uv --exclude-newer` option | Transitive dependencies     | Time-based window |
| Tagged workflow URLs        | Remote workflow references  | Release process   |
| `--from . repomatic`        | CLI from local source       | Release freeze    |

#### Hard-coded versions in workflows

GitHub Actions and npm packages are pinned directly in YAML files:

```yaml
  - uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
  - run: npm install eslint@9.39.1       # Pinned npm package
```

GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs via Renovate's [`helpers:pinGitHubActionDigestsToSemver`](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-helpers/#helperspingithubactiondigeststosemver) preset, which rewrites every `uses:` ref to a 40-character SHA with the semver tag preserved as a trailing comment. A [custom regex manager](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/renovate.json5) handles npm packages pinned inline in workflow files.

#### Renovate cooldowns

To avoid update fatigue, and [mitigate supply chain attacks](https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/11/21/We-should-all-be-using-dependency-cooldowns), [`renovate.json5`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/renovate.json5) uses stabilization periods (with prime numbers to stagger updates).

This ensures major updates get more scrutiny while patches flow through faster.

#### `uv.lock` and `--exclude-newer`

The `uv.lock` file pins all project dependencies, and Renovate keeps it in sync.

The [`--exclude-newer`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#exclude-newer) flag ignores packages released in the last 7 days, providing a buffer against freshly-published broken releases.

#### Tagged workflow URLs

Workflows in this repository are **self-referential**. The [`prepare-release`](https://github.com/kdeldycke/repomatic/blob/main/.github/workflows/changelog.yaml) job's freeze commit rewrites workflow URL references from `main` to the release tag, ensuring released versions reference immutable URLs. The unfreeze commit reverts them back to `main` for development.

### Release engineering

A complete release consists of all of the following:

- Git tag (`vX.Y.Z`) created on the freeze commit.
- GitHub release with release notes matching the `changelog.md` entry.
- Binaries attached for all 6 platform/architecture combinations (linux-arm64, linux-x64, macos-arm64, macos-x64, windows-arm64, windows-x64).
- PyPI package published at the matching version.
- `changelog.md` entry with the release date and comparison URL finalized.

If any item is missing, the release is incomplete.

#### Freeze and unfreeze commits

The [`prepare-release`](#github-workflows-changelog-yaml-jobs) job creates a PR with exactly **two commits** that must be merged via "Rebase and merge" (never squash):

1. **Freeze commit** (`[changelog] Release vX.Y.Z`): finalizes the changelog date and comparison URL, removes the "unreleased" warning, freezes workflow action references to `@vX.Y.Z`, and freezes CLI invocations to a PyPI version.
2. **Unfreeze commit** (`[changelog] Post-release bump`): reverts action references back to `@main`, reverts CLI invocations to local source, adds a new unreleased changelog section, and bumps the version to the next patch.

The auto-tagging job depends on these being **separate commits**: it uses `release_commits_matrix` to identify and tag only the freeze commit. Squashing would merge both into one, breaking the tagging logic.

On `main`, workflows use `--from . repomatic` to run the CLI from local source (dogfooding). The freeze commit pins these to `'repomatic==X.Y.Z'` so tagged releases reference a published package. The unfreeze commit reverts them for the next development cycle.

#### Squash merge safeguard

The [`detect-squash-merge`](#github-workflows-release-yaml-jobs) job catches squash-merged release PRs by checking if the head commit message starts with `` Release `v `` (the PR title pattern) rather than `[changelog] Release v` (the canonical freeze commit pattern). When detected, it opens a GitHub issue assigned to the person who merged, then fails the workflow. Existing safeguards in `create-tag` prevent tagging, publishing, and releasing from a squashed commit.

The net effect of squashing freeze + unfreeze leaves `main` in a valid state for the next development cycle: the maintainer releases the next version when ready.

#### `workflow_run` checkout pitfall

When `workflow_run` fires, `github.event.workflow_run.head_sha` points to the commit that *triggered* the upstream workflow, not the latest commit on `main`. If the release cycle added commits after that trigger (freeze + unfreeze), checking out `head_sha` produces a stale tree.

The fix: use `github.sha` instead, which for `workflow_run` events resolves to the latest commit on the default branch. The `workflow_run` trigger's purpose is *timing* (ensuring tags exist), not pinning to a specific commit. See [actions/checkout#504](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/504) for context on checkout's default merge commit behavior.

#### Immutable releases

The release workflow creates a draft, uploads all assets, then publishes. Once published with [GitHub immutable releases](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/immutable-releases) enabled, tags and assets are locked. Tag names are permanently burned: reinforcing the skip-and-move-forward principle.

Immutability only blocks **asset uploads and modifications** on published releases (`HTTP 422: Cannot upload assets to an immutable release`). Published releases can still be **deleted** (along with their tags via `--cleanup-tag`).

**Dev releases use drafts.** The [`sync-dev-release`](#github-workflows-release-yaml-jobs) job creates dev pre-releases as drafts (`--draft --prerelease`) rather than published pre-releases. Drafts allow the workflow to upload binaries and packages after creation. The release stays as a draft permanently: it is never published. On the next push, `cleanup_dev_releases()` deletes all existing `.dev0` releases (drafts are always deletable) before creating a fresh one. See `repomatic/github/dev_release.py` for implementation.

#### Concurrency strategies

Workflows use two concurrency strategies depending on whether they perform critical release operations. Read the `concurrency:` block in each workflow file for the exact YAML.

**`release.yaml`: SHA-based unique groups.** Tagging, PyPI publishing, and GitHub release creation must run to completion. Using conditional `cancel-in-progress: false` doesn't work: it's evaluated on the *new* workflow, not the old one. If a regular commit is pushed while a release workflow is running, the new workflow would cancel the release because they share the same concurrency group. The solution: give each release run its own unique group using the commit SHA. Both `[changelog] Release` and `[changelog] Post-release` patterns must be matched because when a release is pushed, the event contains **two commits bundled together** and `github.event.head_commit` refers to the most recent one (the post-release bump).

**`changelog.yaml`: event-scoped groups.** `changelog.yaml` includes `github.event_name` in its concurrency group to prevent cross-event cancellation. Without `event_name`, the `workflow_run` event (which fires when "Build & release" completes) would cancel the `push` event's `prepare-release` job, then skip `prepare-release` itself (due to `if: github.event_name != 'workflow_run'`), so `prepare-release` would never run.
